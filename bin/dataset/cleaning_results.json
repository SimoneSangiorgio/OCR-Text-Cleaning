Among tho Arabjans itappeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establi shment of Christianity; and it has only aſsumed its prosent form since the division af the Latin and Greok churches; at which time, lhe idea becoming prevalent, that a Lcltin body could not corrvpl if buried in their territory, it gradually increosed, and formed lhe subject of many wonderful stories, ſtill extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding uponlhe blood of tho young and beautiful. In the West itspread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whoro the helies existed, that vompyresnightly imbi6ed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of c0nsumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of ropletion, as t0 cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their badies, and even fr0m the ucry pores of thoir skins.\nIn theLond0n Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiovs, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to hove accurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief arid magistrates of tbe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had bcen beclrd to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the fr0ntiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euj1, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing himſelf with his blood. This prccaution, however, did not prevent him from bccoming a vampyre himſels; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complainod of hauing 6een tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived os life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the lnhabitants havjng consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and f ound it (aſ is supposed to be usual in cafes of uampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the rnouth, riose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely lhrough the bearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hauecried out cls dreadfully as is he had been olive. This done, they cut ofs his head, burned his body, and threw lhe asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of th ose persons who had previously dicd from varnpyrism, lest they should, in theirturn, become clgentf upan others who survived them.\nThe universa1 belief js, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, arid sucks in his turn.\nChlef bai1iff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems betler adapted to illustrate the subject of the prcsent o6servations than any other iristance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of pvnishment after doatb, for some hein ous crime commjtted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not anly doomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine bis infernal vjsitations solely to thofe beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom be was bound by ties of kindr od and affeclion.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut firſt on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corſe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natiue place, And suck thc blo0d of all thy race; There srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet l0atbe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living corſe,Thy victims, ore they yet expirc, ShaIl know the demon for tbeir fire; As cvrſing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime musl fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flaine! Yel thou must end thy task and inark Her c heek's last tinge—hor eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freozes o'er its lifeless b1ue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock wheri sborn Affcction's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of lhine agony! Yet with thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then sta1king to thy sullen gravc, Go—arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrjnk away From spcctre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey hcls also intraduced in his wild bul heavtiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vompyre corfe of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as havirig returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hirn shc best loved whilst in exiſtence.Bvt this cannot be supposed to havc resulted from the sinfulneſs of her life, she being pourtrayed througbout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciouſ Tourncf0rt gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his greot work upon this subject, besides avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of jts effects, has put forth ſome learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errar.\nMany curious and intcresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; tbough the present may suffiee for the limjts of a note, neceſsarily devoted to explanation, and which inay now be conc1uded 6y merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, thcre are scvercll others synonymous withit, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the variovs partles af lhe leaders of the ton anobleman, inore rcmarkable for his singularitjes, thcln his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where th0ughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe,could nat cxplajn whencc it arose: some attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object's face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim t0 be invited to every bou fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight af en nui, were pleased at having somelhing in their preserice capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue 0f his foce, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passiori, lhough its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc fcmale hunters after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who bad been tbe mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms ſince her marriage, threw herse1f in his way, and did all but put an the dress of a mauntebank, to attract his not ice:—thoughin vain:—when fhe stood before him, though his eyes were apparonlly fixed upon her 's, ſtill it seemed as lf they were unperceived;—evcn her unappalled iinpudonce wcls baffled, and she left the fiold. But though the comm0n adultress could not inflvence everi the guidancc of hiſ eyos, it was not that tbe female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whelher it was that it even ouercarne the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females who form the boast of thejr sex from their domestic virtues, as amang thoſe who sully it by their vices.\nAhout the ſame time, there cclme to Lond0n a yourig gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet jn childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it tbeir duty merely to take care of hls fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind lo tbe care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than hiſ judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the vcsting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to tho painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, jn sine, that the dreams os poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and rieh: for lhese reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers svrrounded bim,striving which shovld describe wlth least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daug-\nhterſ at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whenbo opened his lips, s0on led him into false notions of his talenls and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram ance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax cclndles that flickered, not from the presencc of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in recll life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from whjch he had formed his study. Fjnding, however, some compensati0n in bis gratified vanity, he was aboul to reliriqvishhis dreams, when the extraordinary belng we have above dcscrjbed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tbe vory impossibility of forming an idea of the charocler af a man entirely absorbed in himself, wh0 gaue few other signs of hif obseruation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of tbeir contact: allowing his irnagination t0 picture every thlng that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object inta the ber0 of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather thanthe persori besore him. He became acqv ainted with him, paid him atteritions, and so sar advanced upon his notice, that his presenco was alwoys recagnised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affoirs were embarrafsod, and soon found, from the notes of preparatlon in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirouſ of gaining some informalion respeeling this ſirigular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, thot il was time for him to perform the taur, which for many gerierations has been tbougbl necessary to enoble lbe yaung to take some rapid steps in the career of uice towards putti ng themselves upon an equality with the oged, and not allowing them to appear as if falleri froin the skies,whenever scaridalovs intrigues are mentloned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pralse, accordlrig to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning bis intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla-\nttered by such a mark of estcem frorn him, who, apparently, had nolhing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed lhe circling waterf.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and n0w he fovnd, that, though many more of bis actians were exposed to his viow, the results offered different concluslons from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse ln his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, reeeived from his hand more thari enough to relieve their immediale wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, lhat it was not upon the virluous, redvced ta iridigence by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuc, thal he beslowed his cllms;—these were sent from lhe door with hardly suppressed sneers; 6ut when thc profligate carne lo ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in hjs lust, or to sink him sti1l deeper in his iniquily, he was sent away with rich charity. This wos, howover, attributedby him to the greater importunity of tho vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was ono circumstance about the charity 0f his Lordship, which was stlll more lmpresfed up0n his mind: all lhose upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found thot therewas a curse vpon it, for they were all either led to the seaffaId, or sunk to the lowest and the most abjcct mjsery. At Brussels and othcr t owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparent eagerness with whieh his companion sought for the eentres of all fashionable vicc; there he entered jnto allthc spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari he gainod; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so wben he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckleſs fclther of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law—this apparent abstracledness of mind wcls Iaid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left tbe formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, curſing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reaeh os this fiend; wbilst many a father sat fraritic, clmidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immenſe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fcltisfy thelr present craving. Yet ho took no money from thc gambling table; bvt immediatoly lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the more exp-\nerienoed. Aubrey often wisbed to represent tbjſ to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl, and dld not terid to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, tbis never occurrcd. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: hiſ eye spoke less than his lip; and thougb Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of voinly wishing to break tbat rnyſtery, which t0 his exalted imagination bcgan to assumo the appearance of something svpernalural.\nThey s0on arrived ot Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendarice upon the morning circlc of an Italian countess, whilst he wenl in search of the memorials of another almost desertod cily. Whilst he waſ thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first wos from his sister, breathing nothirig but affection; lhe others were from his gvardians, the latter astanished him; if it had hesore entered into his imagination that thcre was an evil power resident in his companion, these soemed to glve hjm sufficienl reason f0rthe belief. His guardians jnsisted upon his immedialely leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresjstible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discouered, that his contempt for the a dultress had not originated in hatred of hercharacter; but thot he had reqvired, to erihance his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, shovld be hurled from the pinnclcIe of vnsullicd virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and dogradation: in fine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, hod, since his departvre, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to tbe public gaze.\nAubrey detcrmined upon leaving one, whose cbclracter had not yet shown a sjngle bright point on which t0 rest tbe eye. He refolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, ond to let no slight circurnslances pass by unnotlced. He entered into the ſame cir cle, and soon percoived, that his Lordship was ondeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldam that an unmarried female is met with in socjety; he was theref0re obliged to oarry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fallowedhim in all his windingf, and soon diseoverod that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, whlch would mosl likely ond in tho ruin af an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked hiin his intenlions wlth respect to the lady, informing him atthe same time that be was aware of his being about to meet her thal uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his inlentions were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon b eing pressed wbether he intended to marry her, merely laughcd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram that moment he must declirie accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he orderod his servarit to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho rnother of the lady, inf orined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sont hiſ scrvant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion ofhis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving lest Rome, Aubrey djrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the housc of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of anclent glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling thc deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soil or many co1oured lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, exlsted a being, so beautiful and delicate, thal she might have sormed the model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on carivass tbe promised hope osthe saithful in Mahomet's parcldise, savothat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plajn, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof hcr becluties; for who would have exchangcd hcr eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurlous look of the animaI suited but to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, sloatirig as it were upon the wind, to thc eager gazc of him, who forgot lhe letters he had jvst decypbcred upori an almosl effaced ta6let, in the contemplation of her sylph-Iike figure. Oflen would her tresses falIing, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s un's ray such delica tely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who lel escape from his mirid the very objecl he had before thaughl of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preseruo a memorjaI for hls future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all thc glowing colours af youthsul memory,the marriage pomp ſhe remernbered viewing in her irifancy; and then, turning to subjoctsthat had evidentIy madc a greater impreſsion upon her mjnd, would tell him all the superriatural talcs of her nurse. Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narratod, excited tho interest even of Aubrey; and oftenas she told him the tale of the living uampyre, wha had passed years amidst his fricnds, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upon tbe life of a lovely semalc to prolong his existerice for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst be attempted to laugh her out of such id1e and horrible fantasles; but Ianthe citedto him the riames os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children hod been found marked with lhe stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hirn so incredulous, she begged of him to bclieve her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, alwayſ had some proof giveri, which obljged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to con fess it was trve.She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters, and hjs horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven; he, hawevcr, ſtill persisted in persuclding her, that thore could 6e na truth in her fears, though at the same tirne he wondcred at the mariy coiricidencos which had all tended to excjte a belief in tho supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.\nAubrey began to attoch himself more clnd more to Ianthe; her innoeence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtues of the women among whom he had sovght f0r bis visiori of romance, won his heart; and whlle he ridjculed the idca of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found hiinself m0re and more ottachod to lhe almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ottimes fr0m her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wos attained; but he always fourid it lmpofsible to fix his attention upori the rvins around him, whi1st in his mind he retained an irnoge that seemed aIone the rightful possessor of his tboughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insantile being he had first known. She always seemed to pclrt from him witb roluclarice; but it was becaufe she had rio longer any one with whom sbe could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragmenl which bad yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeaIed ta her parents on the subject of Vampyres, andthey both, with sevcr al prefent, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursionſ, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they beard the name of the pla ce, thoy all at once be gged of him not to retvrn at night, as he must nocessarily pasf through a wood, where noGreek would ever remain, aster the day bad closed, vpon any conſideration. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced lhe most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey rnade light of their representations, and tried to lavgh them out of lhe idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his darjng thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he wos silent.\nNext m0rriing Aubrey set off upon his exoursian unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to sind lhat his words, mocking the bolief of those horri6le fiends, had lnspired them with fuch terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged os him to returri, ere night allowed the power os these boirigs to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, thal he did not perceive tbat doy-light would soon ond, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer cllmates, so rapidIy gather into a tremendous mass, and paur aIl their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, determined to mako up by speed for his delay: hut it waf too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost vnknown; immediate1y tho sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wclf above—lts echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliago, whilst thc blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hiſ uery feet. Suddenly his horse toak srighl, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity througb the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, clnd he found, 6y the glare of lightning, that he was iri the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead lcaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approachcd, hoping to find some one to guide him to the t0wn, or at lcast trusting to obtain sheltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, fora moment silenl, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery os a laugh, contjnued iri one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced operi the door os the hut. He f0und himsclf in utter darkness: the sound, h0wever, guidedhim. He was apparently vnperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of bim. He found himself in c0n tacl with some one, whom he jmmediately ſeized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" t0 which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his Iife cls dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hisbreast, had pIaced bis hands upon his thraat—when thc glare of mony torches penetrating through the hole thclt gave light in the day, disturbod him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cl momenl the crasbirig of the branches, as he broke throvgh the wood, was rio longer heard. Thc st0rm was now stiIl; and Aubrey, incapable os moving, was soon heard by those wilbout. They entered; tbe light of their torches fell upon the mvd wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what waf his horror, when the lighl of tbe torches once mare burst upon hiin, to perceive the airy form of hls fair conductress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was 6ut a visjon arisirig from hls disturbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet th ere was a stillness abaut her foce that seemed almost as ottaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simvltaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickIy formed, and Au6rey waslaid by the side of her who had lately been to him thc objeot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had dled within her. He knew nol whot his thoughts were—his mirid was benumbed and seemcd to shun reflection, and take refvge in vacancy—he held almast uriconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constrvction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engagedjn the search of ber wham a mother had missod. Their lamcntable cries, cls they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. —To describe their grlef would be impossible; but whenthey ascertained the cause 0f their child'f death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointcd to the corse. They were inconsolable; botb died br0ken-hearted.\nAubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most vialent fever, and was often delirjovs; intheſe intervals he would ea1l upori Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe—hy some unaccountable combination he seemed la beg of his former compclnion to sparo the being hc loved. At other times he would imprecote maledictionsupon his head, and curse him as her destrayer. L0rd Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive al Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, andbecame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrisjed and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now com6ined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his klnd words, iinplying cllmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care whichhe showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quile changed; he na longer appeared that apathetic being who had ſo astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his eonvalescerice began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon hirn, wilh a smi1e of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smilo hau-\nntcd him. During the last ſtage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was clppclrently engaged in watohing the tideless waves raised by the cooling breozo, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, 1ike our world, the moveless fun;—lndeed, he appeared to wish to av0id tbe eyef of all.\nAubrcy's mind, by this sbock, was much weokened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of ſolitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind couId nat find it in tbe neighbourhood of At hens; if he sought it amidsl the ruins hehad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in tbe woods, her light step would appear wandering amldst the underwood, jn quest of the m0dest violet; then sudderily turning rovnd, would show, to hls wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. Ho determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crcated such bitter associcltions in hif mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he heId himself bound hy the tender cclre he had taken af him during his illness, that tbey sbouId visit those parts of Greecc neilher had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to whicb o recollectjon covId be attaohed: but thougb they thus haslened from place to place, yet they seomed not ta heed what they gazed upon. Tbcy heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to slight thesc reports, which they jmagined were only the invention of individvals, whosc interest it was to excite the generosily of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus rieglceting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasiori they travellcd with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torront, wilh large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiees, they had reason t0 repent their negligence; for scarccly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the cchoed report of sevcral guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placirig themselves behind rocks, had hegun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their exarnple, retired for a moment behjnd the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting fhouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the r0bbers should climb above and take lhom in the rear, they determlned at once to rush forward jn search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contcst or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, imrnediately thrown up their arms and surrendored.\nBy promises of greal reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded fricnd to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the pr0mised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's ſtrengthrapidly deoreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advanoing with hasty steps. His coriduct and appeorance had not chonged; he seomed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objeets about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, andhis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his asfistanoe with mare than usucll earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my exjſtence aſ liltle as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your friend's hanour.\"—\"How? lell me how? I would do any thirig,\" roplied Aubrey.—\"I need bul little—my life ebbs apace—I eannot explain thc whole—but if you would conceal all yau know os ine, rny honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were un kriown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shaIl not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exvltant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year anda day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any woy, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—Hif eyes se omed burstingfrom their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.\nA ubrey retired to rest, but did not slcep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintoriee with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered hls ooth a cold shivering came 0ver him, as if from the presentiment of something horrl6le awaiting him. Rising earIy in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which he hcld left the corpse, when a robbcr met him, and informed himthat it was no 1ongcr there, having been c0nveyed by himself orid comrades, upon hif retiring, lo the pinnaole of a neighbouring mount, aecording to a promife they hcld given his lordship, thal it should he exposed to the first cold ray of tho moon thatrose ofter his declth. Aubrey aftonished, and taking several of lhe men, determined to go and bvry it upon the spot where it Iay. But, wben be had mounted to lhe summit he sound no trace of either lhe corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they bad laid the b0dy. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that tbey had buried the corpſe for the sake of the cl0lhes.\nWeary of a courilry in which he had met with ſuch terrible mjsfortunes, and iri which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, he res olved l0 leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to canvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he oceupied himsels in arranging those effects he had with him belongjng to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapled to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning tbem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at fjnding a sheath apparently orriamented in tbo same style as the dogger diſcovered in the fatal hvt—he shuddcred—haſtening to gain furtber proof, he found tho weapon, and his borror may be imagjned when he discovered that it fitted, though pocuIiarly shaped, the sheatb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed ga2ing to be bound to lhe dagger; yct stilI he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon lhe haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for d oubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Ro me, his fjrst inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and sbe had nat been heard of since lbe departuro of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almostbroken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid lhat this lady had fallen a victiin to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted jn urging lhe speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which ſeemed abedierit to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and hc hostened to the mansiori of his fatbers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantinc caresses, had gainod his affection, now that the woman began to appear, sbe was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had riot that winnlng grclce wbich gains the gaze and appIause of tbe drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of thclt light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blve oye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm ab0ut it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, bvl from some feelirig within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was riot that light sooting, which strays whero'er a butterfly ora colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alorie, her face was never brightened by the smile of jay; but when her br0ther breat-\nhed to her his affect ion, and would in her presence forget lhase griefs she knew dostroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her fmile for that os the uoluptvary? It seemod as if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preseritation should 6e delayed untiI her brother's returri fromthe continent, when he might be hcr protector. It was now, therefore, resoIved thclt the next drawing-room, which was fastapproaching, should be the epoch of ber entry into the \"buſy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave reinained in the mansion os his fathers, and fed up0n the ineIancboly which overpowered him. He could not feel interesl about the frlvolities of fashionable strongers, when bis mind had been so torri by the events he had witnessod; but he determined to sacrifice hls own comfort to the protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared f0r the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nTbe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and al1 who were clnxious to bask in the s mile of royally, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While ho was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all araund him, cngaged in tho remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very plaoe—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his eor—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage t0 turn, fearfuI of seeing a spectre that would blast hjm, when he perceiued, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice ori this spot upon his first entry into so cicty. He gozed till hls limbſ almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and foreing a paſsage through the crowd, he threw himself irito his carriage, and wos driven home. Hc paced thc room with hurried steps, and fixcd his hands upon bis head, as jf he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances star-\nted up in dreadfvl array—the dagger—bis oath.—He roused himsels, he could nal believe it possible—the dead rise agoin!—He thought his imaginalion had conjured up the image hif mirid was rest-\nirig upon. It was impofsible that it couId be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attemptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurig vpon his lips, and he eauld not succecd in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection os a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave hiinself up ta his own devouring thovghts.Pcrceiving, at last, that many were leaving, ho roused himſelf, and entering another room, found his sister furrounded by several, apparently in earnest canversalion; he attemptod to pass and get near her, when one, wbom he requested to move, tvrned round,and reveoled lo him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sjster'sarm, and, with hurried step, forcod her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting f0r their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, be again heard that voico whisper eIose to him—\"Remember your oalh!\"—He did not darcto turn, but, hurrying his sister, soori reached home.\nAu6rey became cllmost distracted. If befare his mind had been abſorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engroſsed, now that the certainty of the inonster's 1iving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain thal she intrcated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt condu ct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, tbe more he was bewildered. His aath startled him;—was he thcn to allow this monster to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, ainidst all he held dear, and not avert its progrefs? His very sister mlght hclve been tauched by hlm. But euen if be were to break his oath, and disclose bif suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing bis own hand to free the world fram such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already inocked. For days ho remained in this state; shut up in his room,hc fow no one, and ate only when his ſister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stil1ness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from streot to stroet, anxious to fly that image whioh haunted hiin. His dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no langer to 6e recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him downto rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safoly, employed people to follow him; butthey were soon distonced by him who fled from a pursuer swister than any—from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily chariged. Struck with the idea thal ho left by his absence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence tbey were unconscious, he determined to cnter agoin into society, and watcb bim clasely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when heentered into a room, hls haggard and suspicious looks were so st riking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstclin from seeking, for her sake, cl society which offected hlm so strongly. When, however, remonſtrance proved vnavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whjch had boen bofore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dai ly encountered in hls wanderings, and of preventirig him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what tbey considered folly, they engaged aphysician to reside iri tbe house, and take conslant care of him. He hard1y appeared to notice it, so completely was bis mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherenee beeame at laft so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wovld often lie for days, incapable af being roused. He had become emaciated, his cyes had attained a glassy lustrc;—the only sign of afsecti0n and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tho enlry of hissister; then hc would sometirnes start, and, sejzing her hands,with looks thal severely afflicted her, he would dosire her not to touch hirn. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your loue for me is aught, do riot go rieor him!\" Wben, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he ſank jnto a state, wbence riot even she could rouse him. Thif lasted many months: gradually, however, as the yeclr was passing, his incoherenees became less frequent, and hiſ mind tbrew off a portion of its gloom, whilſt his guardians observed, thal severcll t imes in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite numher, and tben smile.\nThe lime had nearly elapscd, when, up0n the lclst day of the year, one of his guardians enterlng his raom, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avbrcy's being in so awfu1 a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. InstantlyAubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch tbey feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a young Earl whom he had met with in sociely, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis iritontiori to be presenl at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sist er. They answered not, but in a few minutes his fister was with him. He was apparcntly again capable of being asfected by the influence of her lovely smiIe; for he pressed her tohis breast, and kissed her cheek, wot with tears, fl0wing at the thought of her brolher's bejng once more alive to tbe feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmlh, and to congratvlate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank arid euery accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprjse at beholding the features of the monster who had so long inf1uenced his life. He seized tbe portrait ln a paroxysm of rage, and trampIed jt under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future busbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then ſeizing her hands, arid gazing on her with a srantic expression of countcriance, he badeher swear thatshc would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if tbat voice again bade hirn rememberhis oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard lhe whole, and thought this wcls but a return of his disorder, ent-\nered, and sorcing him from Miss Aub rey, desired hcr to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, be begged of them to deIay but for one day. They, attrjbvting thisto the insanjty they imagined had taken possession of hls mind, endeovaured to pocify him, and rctired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had beon refused with every one else. Wheri he heard of Aubrey'ſ ill hecllth, he readily understood himself ta be the cause os it; but wheri he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation andpleasure could hardly be concealed from those among wham he had gained this informatjon. Ho hastoned to the house 0f his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and the pretence os great offection for the brother and intorest in his fale, he graducl1ly wori the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resisl his power? Hiſ t0ngue had dangers and toils to recovnt—could speak of himse1f as of an individual having no sympathy with any being ori the crowded earth, save wlth her lo whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew ber, his exislonce, hadbegun to seern worthy of preservation, if it were merely tbat he might listen ta her soothirig aocents;—in fine, he knew so woll how to use the serpent's art, orsuch was the will of fate, tbat ho gained her affeotions. The title of the elder 6ranch falling at length to him, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hasteningthe marriage, (in spito of her brother's deranged state,) wbich waſ to take place the very day before hls departure for the contincnt.\nAubrey, when he was lefl by the physician and his guardians, atlempled lo bribo the servclnts, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; hewrote a letter to his sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own boriour, and the hon0ur of thoſe now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for o fow hovrs that rnarriage, on which hc den0unced the mosl heavy curses. The servonts promised they would deIiver it; bul giving lt to the physicion, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates os the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the nates os busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of corriages broke upon his ear. Aubrcy grew almost franlic. Thc curiosity of the servants at last overcame thejr vigilance, thoy graduolly slole away, leaving hirn in the custody of an helpless old womari. He seized the apportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a rnoment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takinghis arm hy force, hurried hlm from the ro0m, speechless with rage. When on the ftaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my 6ride ta day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So fclying, he pushed him towards his atlend ants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no loriger support hiinself; his ragenat firiding vent, had broken a blood-vesſel, and he was c0nveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, whowas not present when he eritered, as the physician waf afraid of agitatirig her. The marriage was solcmnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion 0f blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his ſisler's guardians might bo called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related c0mposedly what the reader haf perused—he died immediately after.\nThe gvardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wben they arrived, it was too 1 ate. Lord Ruthven had disclppeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thjrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tbe world was alI beforehim, where to chaose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greeian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 18I2, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certcliri supply of cattle and vegetables always to 6e had there, induce many British vessels lo visit it—both men of war and merchontmen; and tbough it lies rather out of lhe tra ck for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviotion of a voyage. We landed; as usua1, at the boltom of thc bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myse1f to0k a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticuIe so named) we mct witb and engclged a young Greek as ovr guide, who told us he hcld come from Scio with an English lord, wbo lest the islarid sour days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pjlot,\" said tbe Greek, \"andwould have taken me with him; but I did not choose to qvit Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was anodd, bvt a very good man. The cottage over the hil1, facing the river, belongs to hjm, and he has left an old mcln in cbclrge of it: ho gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has reslded there about fourteen months, though not constant1y; for he sa ils in his felucca very 0ften to the differont is1ands.\"\nThis account excitedour cvriosity very mueh, and we lost no time in hastening tothe house whore our countryrnan had resjded. We were kindly recejved by an old man, who conducted us ouer the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrclnce hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlovr, and a6ed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnarble tablcs on ejther side, a large myrtle ln the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which couId be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in tbe side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairf, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread an the floor, with two stuffed cotlon quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In tho sitling-ro0m we obscrved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which were then in a lclrge seaman's chest jn the closel: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts. Ori the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rausseau's works comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mllton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed at Parma in 1810; severa1 small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplc, much torn, hut no English book of any description. Most of those bookſ were filled with marginal notes,written wlth a pencil, in Italian ond Latin. The Messiah was lilerally scri6bled all over, and marked wilh slips of paper, on whioh alsa were remarkſ.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had bcen reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there thcy must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to rnove one thing without orders, he would frown upon rne for a week together; hcis oth erways very good. I oncedid him a service; and I have the produce of tbis farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechin es which I pay t0 an aged Arrnenian who rcsldes in cl small cottage in the wood, and whom lhe lord brought bero from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanee of the house externally waſ pleasjng. The portico ln frorit was fifly paces Iong and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars witb 6lack pljnths and fret-work cor nices, (as it is now customary jn Grecian architecture,) were confiderably bigher lhan the roos. The roof, surroundedby a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tvrkey earpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most os thc housc-tops are thuf furniſhed, af upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we enlered the house, a srnall streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on itſ borders, and under thc shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed mariy of his evenings ond nlghts till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" sclid the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devo-\nut, \"and always attended our churcb twice a week, besjdes Sundays.\"\nThe view fr0m this seat wcls what may 6etermed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye ta Mount CalcIa, coverod witb olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on lhe summit of which an ancient Greek ternple appeared in majestio decay. A fmall stream issuing from the ruins descended in brokencascades, untjl il wos losl iri the woads noarthe mouritain's base. The sea smooth as g1ass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, lhrough a vista oflofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands werc distinotly observed, ſtuddjng the light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I feldom enjoyed a vjew more tban I djd this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person wh0 had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wha had gone to Candia. \"Tbe Armeniari,\" said ovr c0nductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he wlll not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I con,\" sald he, \"I dare not.\" We had not tirne to vlsit the Armenian, 6ut on ovr return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. Ho hod portioned eight young girlswhen he was laſt vpon tbe lsland, and oven danced with them at the nuptial feasl. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, ond cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. Ho also bought a newboat for a fishermari who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave GreekTestamonts to tho paor children. In ſhort, he appeared to us, from all we coIlected, to have been a very ecoentric and benevoIent character. Ono circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at thc c otlage thought proper not to disolose. He had a most beautiful daugbter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and he hod bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch waſ the information with which we departed from the peaeeful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on tbe rack, guessjng who this rambler iri Greece cavld be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and alI those eccenlrioities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dovhtf were dispelled. FaIlingin compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt andGreece, \"The indivjdual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I mel him in my travols on the ifland of Tenedos, arid I alſo visited hirn at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordsbip's fame, as we bad been some years fram home; but \"Chi1de Harolde\" being put into our hondſ we recognized the recluse of Calcla in overy page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we corisolcd ourselvef with the idea of returning t0 Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never retum. I make thls statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordsbip's good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has been dcscribcd as of an unfeeling dlsposition, avcrse to associatjng with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its forrows, or add lo jts pIeasures. Tbe fact is directly tho reverse, oſ may be plalrily gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feolings of the heart, sa elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of ſolitude is an additional reason for marking hjm cls a being on whosc heart Reljgion bath set her seal, and over whosehead Benev0lence hath thrown her inontle. No man can rcad the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a eountryman. With respect to his loves or pleasuros, I do not assume a right to give an oplnion. Reports are ever tobe received with caut-\nion, pclrticularly wheri directed against man'ſ moral integrity; arid be wbo dares juslify bimself beforc that awful tribunal where all must appear, cllone may censure the errors os a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good insecret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony 0f a virtuous heart andself-approving conscierice.\nTHE END\nGiIlet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "ground_truth": "THE VAMPYRE;",
    "gemini_cleaned": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\n\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\n\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corpses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\n\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\n\nChief bailiff.\n\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\n\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,\nThy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\nThen ghastly haunt the native place,\nAnd suck the blood of all thy race;\nThere from thy daughter, sister, wife,\nAt midnight drain the stream of life;\nYet loathe the banquet which perforce\nMust feed thy livid living corse,—\nThy victims, ere they yet expire,\nShall know the demon for their sire;\nAs cursing thee, thou cursing them,\nThy flowers are withered on the stem.\nBut one that for thy crime must fall,\nThe youngest, best beloved of all,\nShall bless thee with a father's name—\nThat word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\nYet thou must end thy task and mark\nHer cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark,\nAnd the last glassy glance must view\nWhich freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\nThen with unhallowed hand shall tear\nThe tresses of her yellow hair,\nOf which, in life a lock when shorn\nAffection's fondest pledge was worn—\nBut now is borne away by thee\nMemorial of thine agony!\nYet with thine own best blood shall drip;\nThy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;\nThen stalking to thy sullen grave,\nGo—and with Gouls and Afrits rave,\nTill these in horror shrink away\nFrom spectre more accursed than they.\n\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\n\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucoloucha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\n\nTHE VAMPYRE.\n\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon hers, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\n\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\n\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\n\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more exp-erienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\n\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\n\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\n\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\n\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, spoke with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\n\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\n\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile hau-nted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\n\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they left the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\n\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see.\" —His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\n\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he held left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they held given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\n\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\n\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear,",

    "original_ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori\nTHE svperstition upon which lhis tale is founded ls uery general in the East. Among the Arahians it appears to be eommon: it did not, hawever, extend itsels to the Greoks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greckchurches; at which timc, the idea becoming prevalent, thal a Lalin body could nol eorrupt if bvried in their tcrrjtory, it gradually iricreased, and formed the subject of mony wondorful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their gravos, and feeding upon the blood of the young and bcautiful. In the Wesl it sprecld, wilh some slight variation, aIl over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the bolief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion af the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strenglh, and speedily died of consumptions; whilſt these hum an blood-suckers fattened—and theirveins bcoame distended lo such o state of repletion, cls to cauſe the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn tbe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hurigary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commclnder-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they pofitive1y and urianiinously afsjrmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassavia, on lhe frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of thc euil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing hirnself with his blood. This pr ecaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vompyre himself; for, a6out twenty or thirty days after his deoth and burial, many persons complained of having been t0rmented by him, and a depositlon was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitarits having confulted their Hadagni, took up tbe body, and found il (as is supposed lo be usual in ca ses of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptian, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proaf having been thus obtained, lhey res0rted to the accustomed rernedy. A stake wcls driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have oried ovt as dreadfully as if he had been aljve. Thiſ dono, thoy cut off his head, burned his body, arid threw lhe aſhes into his grave. Thc samc moclsures were adopted wlth the corses of lhase persans who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belicf is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vompyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief balliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontode is here related, because it seems better adapted to j1lustrate the sub ject os the present ohservations than any olher instance which could be adduced. In many partsof Greece it is consi dered as a sort af punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased iſ not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal uisitatjons solely to those beings he loved inost while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on eorth, asVampyre serit, Thy corse shall from its lomb be rent; Then ghastly h aunt the natiue pIace, And suck thc blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wifo, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yetloathe the banquet which perforcc Must feed thy livid living corsc, Thy victims, ore they yet expire, ShalI know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on tbe stem. Bul one thal for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, ShaIl bless thee with a father's name— That word sholl wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's 1ast tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glanoe must view Which free2es a'er its lifeless blue; Thon with unhallowed harid sha1l tear The lresses of her yellow hair, Os which, in lifc a lock when shorn Affectjon's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, ond hagg-\nard lip; Then ftalklng to thy fullen gravo, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in harror shrink away From spectre more accursed than tbey.\nMr. Southey bos also introduced in his wi1d but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Orieiza, whois represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of torinenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted srom the sinfulness of her life, she being povrtrayed throughout the whole of the lale os a complete type of purity and innoeence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of severaI astonishing cases af vampyrifm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmot, in hif great work vpon this subject, befides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narr atives illustrative of its effects, bas put forth s0me loarned dissertalians, teriding to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and lnteresting notices on lhis singvlarly horrib1e superstiti0n migbt be added; lhough the present may suffice f0r the limits of a no te, necessarily devoted to explanation, clnd which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several otbers synonymous with it, made use of in various parts ofthe world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations otlendant upori a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the lcaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than hls rank. He gazed upon the mirlh around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, lhe light laughter of the sair onlyattracted his atlention, that he might by a l0okqvell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt thif sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing vpon the obiect'ssace, did not seom to penetrate, and at ane glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaderi ray thclt weighcd upon the skin it oould not pass. His peeuliarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been aceustomed to violenl excitement, and now fe1t the weight of ennui, were pleosed at having somcthing in their presence capa6le of engaging their attention. In spite of the doadly hue oshis faco, which never gained a warmer tint, either from lhe blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters af ter notoriety attemptod to win his attenlions, and gain, at least, same inarks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sbewn in drawing-r0oms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put ori lbe dress af a mountebank, to attracl his notice:—tbough jn vain:—when she stood hefore him, tbough his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was basfled, and she left thefield. But though the common adultress could not irifluence even the guidclnce of his eyes, it was n0t that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet such was the apparent cautian with whieh he spoke to thc virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew hc ever addressed himself to females. He had, bowcver, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whetber it was that it euon ouercame the dread of his singular charocter, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was as often among thofe females who formthe boast of lhoirsex from their domestic virtues, as arnong thase who sully it by their vices.\nAb0ut the same time, there came ta Londan a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the poſsession of great weoltb, by parents who died while ho was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his f0rtune, while thoy relinquished tbe rnore imporlant charge of his mind to the care of merconary subalterns, he cultivated more his iinaginatian tban his judgment. He had, bence, thal high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, which daily ruiris so many milliners' apprentioes. He believed all to sympclthise wjth virtue, and thought that vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for the piclurosque effecl of the scene, as we see in romances: he lhought thot the misery of a cottage inerely consifted in the vesting os clotbes, whicb were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variouf coloured patches. He tbought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Hewas handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon hif entering inlo the gay circles, mclny motbers surrounded him, striving which should deseribo with least truth their languishirig or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their br ightening countenances wheri he a pproached,and by their sparkling eyes, wheri he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ro monce of bis solitary hours, he was startled at findirig, that, except inthe tall0w and wax candles that slickered, not from tho presence of a ghost, but from want of sriufflng, there was no foundatian in real 1jfe for any of tbat congeries of pleasing piclures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from whlch ho had formed his sludy. Finding, however, some compensation in his grotifjed vanity, he waf about to reliriquifh his dreams, wheri the extraordlnary being we have above described, crossed him jn his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility af f0rming an idea0f the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gaue fow 0ther signs of his obfervation of oxternal objccts, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginatjon to plcture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed thls objoct irito the hero of cl romanco, and determined to observe the offsprjrig 0f hjs fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advclriced upon his notice, that his preſonoe was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven'ſ affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street,lhat he was a6out to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, ti1l now, had on1y whetled his curiofity, he hinled t0 his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thovght necessary lo enoble the y0ung to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an eqvality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fa1len from the skies, whenever ſoandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects af pleasantry or of praise, accordirig t0 the degree os skill shewri in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his interitioris to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive frorn him a proposol to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, appareritly, had nothlng iri common with other men, he gladly accepted il, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHithorto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found, that, though many inore of his clctions were exposed to his view, the results offer ed different conclusians from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagobond, arid the beggar, received fromhis hand more lhan enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey covld not avold remarking, that it was not vp0n the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misforlunes attendant even upon virtve, that he bestowed his olms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligclte came to ask somelhirig, not to relieve his warits, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, howeuer, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, wblch generally preuai1s over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigcnt. There was one circvmstance about tbe charity of his Lordship, which was stillmore impressedupon his mind: clll those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there waf a curse upon it, for tbey were all either led to lhescaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the m0st abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which thoy passed, Aubr ey was svrprizod at lhe apparent eagerness with which hls companion sought for the centres of all fashioriabIe vice; thero he entered into aIl the spirit af the fara table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he losl even more than he gained; but it waſ always wjth the some unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash yovthful n0vice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortu ne's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than thcll of the cat whilst dallying with the haIf-dead mouse. In cvery town, he left the formerly affluerit youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fale that had drawn him within thc reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, omidst the spoaking looks of mule hungry children, wlthout a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewith to buy evcn sufficient to satisfy their present crauing. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately l0st, to tho ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innoccnt: this might but be the result of o ccrtain degree of knowledge,which was not, however, copoble of combating the cunriirig of the more exporienced. Aubrey often wished to represcnt this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleclsure which praved the ruin of alI, and did not tend to bisown profit;—but he dolayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speakjng fronkly and openly to him; however, this never oecvrred. Lord Ruthvenin his carriage, ond amidst the vari-\nous wild andrich scencs of nature, was always the same: his eye fpoke less than his lip; and tbaugh Aubrey waf near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greclter gratification from it than the conftarit excitemcnt os vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hjs exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of somelhing supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; be left hjm in daily ottendonce upon the mornlng circle of an Italjan countess, whilsl he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arriued fromEngland, which he opened wilh eagor impatience; the first was from his sisler, breathing nothing but clffection; the others were frorn his guardians, the latter astonished hjm; jf it had beforc enterod into his imaginatiori that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for tho helief. His guardians insjsted upon his lmmediatoly leaving his friend, and urged, tbat his character waf droadfully uicious, for that the possession of irresisti6le po wers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerovs to society. It had been discovered, that his conternpt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had required, ta enhance his gratification, that his viclim, the partnor of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to tbe lowest abyss af infclmy and degradation: in fine, that all those fo males whom he hod sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mosk aside, ond had not scruplod lo expose the who1e deformity of their vices to the public goze.\nAubrey determined upon leclving one, whose cbarocter had not yet shown a single brjght point ori which ta rest the eye. He resoIved to invent some plavsib1e pretext for abandoning him altogetber, purposing, in lhe mean while, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight circumstances pclss by unnoticed. He entered irito the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordshlp was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of thc lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom thclt an unmarried female is met with iri soclety; he was thereforo obliged to car ry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye sollowed him in all his wlndings, and soondiscovored that an assignalion had been appointed, which would most likely ond in the ruin of an innooent, lhough thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he enterod the apclrtment of Lord Ruthven,and abruptly asked him his intentians with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his 6elng about to meet hcr tbat very night. Lard Ruthveri anfwered, thclt his intentioris were such as he supposed all would have upon such an accasiori; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely lavghed. Aubrey retired; clnd, immediately writing a note, to say, tbat from that moment he must dcclirie accompanying his Lordfhip in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her os all be knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also ooneerning the character of his Lordship. The assig nation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servont to notify his complete asserit to a soparation; but did not hint any suspiclon of his plans havlng beon foiled by Aubrey's iriterpositlon.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed bis steps t0wards Greece, and crossing the Periinsula, soon found himself at Atbens. He then fixed hjs residence in the house os a Greek; and ſoon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of clncient glory upori monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronieling the deeds of freemen anly before slaues, bad hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil 0r rnany coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himfelf, existed a being, so beautisul and delicato, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on cariva ss lhe promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's parodise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think fhe could belong to those who bad n0 foulſ. As she danced uponlhe p1 ain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would bave thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animaled nature, for thal sleepy luxvrious look of the animcll suited but to the taste of an epicvre. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the vneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere butterfly, show the who1c beauty of her form, floclting as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot lhe letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tress es falling, as sbe flitted arourid, exhibit in the sun's ray svch delicately brilliant and swift1y fading hves, jt might well excuse lhe forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind thevery object be hod before thought of vita1 importclnco to the proper interpretation os a passclge inPausanias. But why clt tempt to descrlbe charms whieh all feel, but none cari appreciate?—It was jnnocence, youth, and 6eauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew thoseremains of which he wished ta preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and walch the magic effectf of bis pencil, in tracing the scencs os her native p1ace; shc would then describe to him the circling donceupon the open plain, would palnt, to him in all the glowing c0lours of youtbful memory, the marriage pomp she rememhered viewing iri her infancy; and theri, turning to subjects tbat had evidenlly made a greater impression uponber mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nvrse. Her earnestness and apparerit belief of what ſhe narrated, excited the interesteven of Aubrey; and often asshe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidsl his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of alovely female to prolang his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run oold, wbilst he attempted to lavgh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited lo him the nclmes of old men, who had at last detected one liuing among themseIves, after several of their near relatives and children had heen found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite;and when she found him so increduI0us, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, thal those who bad dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged tbem, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She dotailed to him the traditional appearance of thcse monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate desoription of Lord Rulhuen; he, however, still persjsted in persuading her, that there cou1d be rio truth in her fears, thovgh at the same time he wondercd at lhe many coincidences which had all tended to excjto a belief in thesupernatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAuhrey began to attach himfelf more and mare to Ianthe; herinnocence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtuef of the women among wbom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; andwhile he ridieuled the idea of a young inan of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming aplan forsome antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to retvrn until his object was attained; but he always found it iinpossible to fix bif attention upon tbe ruins aroundhim, whilst in his mind he reta iried an irnage that seemed alone the righlful possessor of hls thaughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frclnk infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part fr0m bim wilh reluotance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilsl ber guardian wcls occupied in sketohing or uricovering some fragment wbich had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed lo her parents on the subjeet 0f Vampyres, and they both, with several present, afsirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very namo. Soon after, Aubreydetermjned to proceed upon one of his exeursions, whjcb was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard tbo narne of the place, they all at onee begged af him not to return at night, as he musl necessari1y pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the dcly had closed, upon any consideratiori. They described it as thc resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon hlm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made llght of their representations, and triedto Iaugh them out of the idea; but when he saw thcm shudder at bis daring thus to mock a superior, inf ernal powcr, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Avbrey set off upon his excursion unattcnded; he was surprised to observe the melanchaly face of his host, and was eoncemed to find thclt hls words, mocking the belies of those horrible fiends, hod jnspired tbem with fuch terror. When he was aboul to depart, Ianthe came t0 tbe side of his horse, and earneslly begged of him to return, cre night allowed the power of these beingf to 6e put in action;—he promised. He was, however, fo occupied in his research, that he did nol perceive that day-light would soori end,and thal ln the harlzon there was one of thase specks whieh, iri thc warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage vpon the deuoted country.—He at lclst, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed sor his delay: but it was too late. TwiIight, in these sovthern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the powcr of lhe slorm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced itswcly through the canopying fo1iage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and rcldiate at hiſ very feet. Suddenly his horse took frigbt, and he was carricd with dreadful rapidity through the entclngled forest. The ariimal at last, lhrough satlgue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of Iightning, that he was in the neigh6ourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itse1f up from the masses of dead lcaves and 6rushwood w hich surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping lo find some one to guide him lo the t0wn,or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, al1owed him to hear the dreadful shriekf of a womon mingling with thestifled, exultclrit mockery of a laugh, continued in ono almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused hy lhe thunder which agairi r0lled over his head, he, with a sudden esfort, foroed open the daor of lhe hut.He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, thovgh he called, still the sounds continued,and no notice was taken of hiin. He found himself in conlact wilh some one, whom he immediately seized; when a vojce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by ono whose strenglh seemed fuperhuman: detcrmined lo sell his life as dearly cls he cauld, he slruggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet ond hurled with onormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upori his breast, had placed his hands vpon his throat—when the glare af many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in tho day, disturbed him;—he instaritly rofe, and, leaving his prey, rushed througb lhe door, and in a moment the crashing of lhe brancheſ, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapablo of moving, was soon heard by th0so without. They entered; tbe light of their torches foll upon the mud walls, arid the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. Al the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted hjm by her cries; he was again left in darknesf; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought ina lifeless corse. He shut his cyes, hoplng that it waf but a vlsion arifing from his disturbed imagiriatjon; but be again saw the same form, when be unolosed tbem, stretched byhis fide. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacblng as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was bIood, and upon ber throat were the marks of toeth having opened the vein:—lo this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, arid Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been tohim the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fclllen with lho flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thaughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge iri vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger os a particular construction, which had heen sound in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engoged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached tho city, farewarned the parents 0f some dreadfu1 catastrophe. —To desori6e their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained lhe cause of their child's death, they looked al Aubrey, and pointod to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAvbrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most uiolent fever, and waſ often delirious; in these intervals he would caIl upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unclccountable combinati0n he seemed ta heg of his foriner companion to sparo the bcing he loved. Al other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ohanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Avbroy, immediately placed himself in the same houso, and bocame his c0nstarit attenda nt. When the lattcr recoverod from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight 0f hlm whose imclge he had now combined wilh that of a Vompyre; 6ul Lord Ruthven, by bis kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault thal bod caused thelr separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and carc which he showed, soon reconolled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appcared that apathetic belng who had so aftonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvalescence began to he rapid, he again gradually retired jnto the same state 0f mind, and Aubrey percejved no difference from the former man, except that at tjmes he was surpriſed to meel his gaze fixed intently upon him, witb a smile of malicjous oxultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During tbe last stage of the invalid's recovery, LordRuthven was apparently engaged in watching tbe tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marklng the progress of those orbs, circ1ing, like our world, the inoveless suri;—irideed, hc appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distjnguished him riow secmed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of ſoljtude and silence cls Lord Ruthven; but mucb as hc wished for solitude, his mind c0uld nat find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had farinerly frequonted, Ianthe's form ftood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step wovld appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then svddenly turning round, would show, to hls wild imaginalion, her pale face ond wounded throat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. Hc determined to fly ſcenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he beld himself bound by the tender care he had taken ofhim during his illnesſ, that they should visit those parts of Greeee neither had yot seen. They travelled in every direction, and saught every spot to wbicha recollcction could be attached: but thovgh they thus hastened from plaoe lo place,yet they soemed not t0 heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to ſlight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuaIs, whose intereft it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended srom pretended dangers. In corisequence of thus neglecting the advice of the jnh-\nabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guidef than as a dofence. Upon entering, howeuer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whicb was the bcd of a torrent, with large inasses of rock brought down from the neighbouririg preeipjces, they had reason to repent their negl igence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engagcd in the narrow pa ss, whon they were startled by tbe whistling of bullels close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In cln instant their guards had 1eft them, and, placingthemselves behind rocks, had begun to flre iri the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retjred far a moment behind the shelteririg turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained 6y a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exp0sed to unrcsiſtlng slaughter, if any of thc robbers should climb abovc and take them in therear, they deterrnined at once to rusb forward ln seorch of the enemy. Hardly had they 1ost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his ossistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was saon surprised by seeing the robbers' faees around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately lbrown up their arms ond surrendered.\nBy promises of great roward, Avbrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring oabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content morely to guard the entrance till their comrade shauld return with the promiscd sum, for whlch be had an order. Lord Ruthven's ftrength rapid1y decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death ſeemed advancing with hasty stops. His coriduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objectsabout him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mlnd became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance wjth more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! y0umay save me—you may do more than tbat—I mean not my lise, I heed the dcath of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may ſave my honour, your fricnd's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but litlle—rny lifo ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conccal all you kriow of me, my honour were free from stain in thc world's mouth—arid if rny death were unknown for some tiine in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall nol be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying rnan, raising himself with cxulta nt violerico, \"Swear by all your soul reveros, by clll your nature foars, swear that, sor a yeclr and a day you wiIl n0t impart y0ur knowledgo of my crimes or deatb to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, ar whatever you may see. \"—His eyos seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circurnstances attending his aoquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when hc remembered his oath a cold shiveririg came ovcr him, as jf from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rifing early in thc morriing, be was about to enter the hovel in which he bad left lhe corpse,when a robber mcl him, and informed him that it was no loriger there, baving been conveyed by himseIf and oomrades, upon his retiring, lo the pirinacle of a neighbourjng mounl, accordjng to a promise they had g iven his lordship,thal it should be exposed to the first cold ray of tbe moon that rose afler his death. Aubrey astanished, and tclking several of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot whore it lay. But, when he had maunted to thc ſummit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothos, thougb the robbers sworc they pointed out the identical rock on whlch they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewjldered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that thoy had buried the c orpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had se ized vpon bis mind, he resolued to leave jt, arid soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Noples, he occu pied himsels in arranging those esfects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Amongst other things there was cl case c0ntaining severaI weapons of offerice, more or lefs adapted to ensure tho death of the victim. There were sevcral daggors and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and cxaminirig thejr curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented jn tbe samc flyle as lhe dagger discovered ln thefatoI hut—he shuddered—hastening t0 gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that jl fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no further eertainty—they seemed gazirig to be bound to the daggor; yet still he wished to disbelicve; but tbe particular form, the some uorying tints upan the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and lefl no room for douht; there were also drops of blood on oach.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthueri's seduclive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune rulned, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind becamc almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilioris, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived al Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wasted bim to the English shorcſ; and he hastened to the mansion of his fclthers, and there, for a momont, appeared to lose, in the embraceſ and caresses of his sister, all mcmory of the past. If she bes0re, by her infantine caresses, had gairied hjs affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winnirig grace which gains lhe gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was n0ne of that lighl brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity os the mind beneath. There was a meloncholy chclrm about it whicb did not seem to arise srom misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicalo a ſoul conscious of abrighler realm. Her step was not that light footing, whlch strays where'er a butterfly or a colovr may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alono, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew deſtroyed hjs resl, who would have exchanged ber smile for that of the volupluary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face wore then playing in the light of lheir own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, arid had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's returnfrom the continent, wheri he might be her prolectar. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy sccne.\" Aubrey would rather have remained iri the mansion of his fclthers, and fed upon thc melancholy which overpowered him. He oould not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionahle slrangerf, when bis mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he detormined to sacriflce his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. They soori arrlved in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced af a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was oxcessive—a drawing-room bad nol been held for a lang time, and all wha were anxiovs to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was tbere with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of a11 around him, engaged in the remembrance tbat the first time he had feen Lord Ruthveri was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a vo ico he recognized too well, soun-\nded in his ear—\"Remember yovr oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearfulof seejng a spectre tbot would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the samc figure which had attrocted his n0tice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazod till bis limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of clfriend, and sorcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himseIf into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thaughtswere bursting from his brairi. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started up in dreadsul array—the dagger— hif ooth.—He roused himfelf, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the jmage his rnind was resting upon. It was impossible that it cov1d be real—he dotermjned, thereforc, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask cancerning Lord Ruthveri, the name hung upon hif lips, and he cauld not succeed in galning information. He went a few nights after with his sistor to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired irito a recess, and lhere gave himself up lo hiſ own devouring thovghts. Perceivlng, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entcring anolher room, fourid his sister surrounded by several, apparentIy in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requosted to move, turned round, ond reveaIed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprangforward, seized his fister's arm, and,with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himsolf impeded by tbo crowd of servants who were waiting for theirlords; and while he waf engaged jn passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey becaine almost distracted. Is beforc hjs mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrofsed, now that lhe certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister'f atterilions were now vnheeded, and lt was in vain that shc intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupl conduct. He 0nIy uttered a few words, and those terrifiod her. The more hc thought, the more he was bewildered. His oclth start1ed hi m;—was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, am idst alI he held dear, and riat avert its progress? His very sister mjght bclve been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclase his suspicions, who would believe him? He thoughl of employing his ownhand to free the world from such a wrctch; bul death, he remembered, bad been already moeked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when his ſisler eame, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer copable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image whicb haunted him. His dresſ became neglected, and hc wandered, as osten cxposod to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to he recognized; at first he returned wilh the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue ouerlook him. His sister, anxiouſ for his safety, employed people lo fo1low him; but they were soori distanced by him who fled froin a pursuer swifter than clny—frorn lhought. His conduct, however, suddonly changed. Struek witb the idea that he left by hisabsence tbe whole of his friends, witb a fiend amongſt them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hif oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and sufpjcious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, tbat his sister was at last obljged to beg of him to abstain from soeking, for her sake, a fociety which affected him so strongly. Wh en, hawever, remonstranoe proved unavoiling, the guardians thought proper to intorpose, and, fearing that his mind was bccoming alienated, they thaught it high time to resume agajn that trvst which hod been before imposed upan thcm by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving him frorn the injuries ond sufferings he had daily encountered in his wandcrings, and of preventing him from exposing to lhe general eyc those rnarks of what they considered folly, they engaged a phyfician to residc in tbe hovse, and take canſtant care of him. He hardly appearcd to notice it, so complelely was his mind absor6ed by one terrible fubiect. His incoherence became at last so greot, that he was confined to his choinber. There he would often lie for days, incclpablc of being roused. He had become emaoiated, his eyes had attained a gIassy lustre;—the only sign 0f affection and recallection remairiing displayed ilseIf upon lhe entry of bis sister; then he would sometimes ftart, and, seizing her hondſ, with looks tbat severely afflicted her, be would desire her riot to t0uch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love sor me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his onIy answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank inlo a slate, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year wcls passing, his incoheren ces became less frequont, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observcd, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a dofinitc number, and then smile.\nThe time had rioarly elapsed, wben, upon the last day of the year, ono af his guardians entering his r0om, hegan to converse wilh his physiciari upon tbe melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri hjs sister was going next dcly to be married. Instontly Aubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this rnark of rcturning intellect, of which tbey fe ared he had been deprived, they mentionod the name af the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey secmed pleased, arid astonished them stil1 more by his expressing his interition to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sistor. They answered not, but jn a sew rninuteſ his sister waſ with him. He was apparently again capablo of beirig affected by the influonce 0f her lovely sinile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her hrother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He begcln to speak withall hiſ wonted warmth, and to corigratulale her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceiued a locket upon bcr breast; openirig ll, what wos hif surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his ljfe. He seized the portrait iri a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he Iaoked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing 0n her with a frclntic expression os countenarice, he bade her swear that she would neuer wed this monster, for he— But he could n0t aduance—it seemed as if thal voiceagain bade hjm remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In lho meantime the guardians and physician, who had heord tbo whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Misf Aubrey, desired ber to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, ho begged of them to delay but for one day. They, altributirig this to the insonity they imagined had taken possesſi0n of his mind, endcavourod to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had callcd the morning after the drawing-room, and had heen refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill heallh, he readily vnderstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from t hose among wbom he had gained this inforrnotion. He hastened to tho bouse of hjs former companion, ond, by constant attendarice, and the pretonoe of great clffection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gra-\ndually won the ear of Miss Aubrcy. Who cou1d resist his power?His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of bimself as of an individual having no fympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to wh0m he clddresfed hjmself;—could tell how, since he knew her, hisexistence, had bcgun to seem worthyof preservatjon, if it were merely that he might liſten to her soothing clccents;—in fino, he knew so well how lo use lhe serpent's art, 0r such was the will of fate, that he gained her affeclions. The title of the elderbranch falling at length lo him, he obtained an important embassy, whicb served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (ln spite of her brother's deranged slato,) which wasto take place lhe very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and hjs guardians, attemp ted to bribe the servonts, but in vain. He asked f0r pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuririg her, as sbe ualued her own happiness, hor own horiour, and the honovr of those nowin the grave, who once held her in their arms as thejr hope and the hope of their housc, to delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which he denounced the m0st heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physjcian, he thought it better not to haross any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without resl to the busy inmatesof the house; andAubrey heord, with a horror that may more easily be conceivedthari described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound os carriages broke upon his ear. Aubroy grew almast frantjc. The curiosity of tho scrvants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slole aw ay, leavinghim in the custody of an helplesſ old woman. He seized lhe opportvnity, with one hovnd was out 0f tbe room, and in a moment found bimself in the apclrtrnent where all werc riearly asscmbled. Lord Ruthven was the first t0 perceive him: he immediately approac hed, and, taking his arm by f0rce, hurried him froin the room, speechless with rage. When 0n the stairoase, Lord Ruthveri whifpered in his ear—\"Remembcr your oath, and kn ow, if not my bride to day, yaur sisler is dishonovred. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards hls attendants, who, roused hy the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer fupport himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessol, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned t0 his siſler, who wcls not present whcn he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitatirig her. The marrlage was solernnized, arid lhe bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAubrcy's weakness iricreased; the efsusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of dcath.He desjred his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the tbirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to ch0ose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing throu gh the Grccian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the har6our 0f Mitylene, in the island of lhat name. The beauty of this plaoe, and the certain supp1y of cattle and vogetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit il—both men of war and merchantmen; and lhough it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for tbe deviati0n of a uoyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were emp1oyed in watering, and the purser bargalning for cattle with the nativcs, the clergyman and myself took aramble to the cave called Homer's School, clnd olher plaees, where we had been besore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticu1e so named) we met with and engclged a young Greek as our guide, who t0ld us he had come from Scio wjth an English lord, who left tbe is1and four days previouſ to our arrival jn his felucca. \"He erigaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wouldbave taken me with him; but I did not chooso to qult Mltylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but avery good man. The cottage over the hill, sacing the river, 6elongs to bim, and he has 1est an old man iri charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred 2echines for it, (about L25O English curroncy,) and has resided t here about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islandſ.\"\nTbis account excited our euriosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryrnan had resided. Wc were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us overthe mansion. It cansisted of four apartinents on lhe ground-floor—ari ent rarice hall, a drclwing-r0om, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed.They were all sirnply decorated: plain green-slained wa1ls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in tbe centre, and a small fountoin berieath, which could bemade to play tbrough the 6ranches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning poſlure; a largo couch or sofa compleled the furniture. In the haIl stood holf a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-ease: there were rio mirrors, rior a slrigle pointing. The bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quiltſ and a pil1ow—the common bed throughout Greece. Iri the sitting-room we observed a mclrble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were theri in a largc seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokspeare's, B0ileau's, and Rousseau's works eomplete; Volney's Ruins of Empireſ; Zimmerman, in the Germ ari langvage; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebve's novels; Schiller's playof the Robbers; Miltan's Paradise Lost, ari Italian odition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greok press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were f illed with marginal notes, writtcn with a pencil, in ItaIian arid Latin. Tbe Mesfiah was literally seri6bled all over, and marked with s1ips of paper, on which alſo were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the everiing before he scliIed, and forgot to ploce them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his relurn; for he is so particulclr, that were I to move one thlng without orders, he would frown upon me for a week logether; he is olherways very good. I once did him a service; and I havc the produce of thjs farm for lhe troubleof taking care of it, except twerity zechines which I pay to an clged Armenian who rosides in a small cottoge in the wood, and whom the lord hrought here froin Adrianople; I don't know sor whot reason.\"\nThe appearance 0f the house externaIly was plcasing. The portico in front waſ fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pllnths and fret-work eornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) wereconsiderobly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a lighl stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awriing of strorig coarse linen.Most of the house-topſ are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pclss their evenings in smoking, drinking light winos, such os \"lochryma christi,\" eating frujt, and enjoying tho evening breeze.\nOn the left hclnd as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and lirnes were clustering togetber on its borders, ond undcr the sbade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooderi back was placed, ori which we wcre to ld, the lord passed mony of his evenings and nights till twelve a'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"prayirig\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended ovr church twice aweek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view fromthis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A 1ino os rich virieyards led the eye to Mount CaIcIa, covered with olive and myrtle treef in bloom, and on thesummit of whlcb an ancienl Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small strcam issuing from the ruins descended jn brokeri cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. Tbesea smooth as glass, and ari horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninateſ the view in front; and o little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-treef, several ſmall isIandſ wcro distinctly 0bserved, studding the light blue wave with spots of cmerald green. I seldom enjoyed a vlew m0re thcln Idid this; but our enquirjes were fruitless as to the name of the person who bcld resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his bankcr, who had gone to Cand-\nia.\"The Armenian,\" sald our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tcll, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" Webad not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the lown we lear nl several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was 1ast upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuplial feast. He gaue a cow t0 one man, horses to athers, and cotton and ſilk to the girls wbo live by weavlng these arliclef. Hc also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greok Testaments to the poor chil dren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collectcd, to have been avery eccentric and benevolent character. Onecircumstance we learnt, whjoh our old frierid at the cotlage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most boautiful daughter, with whom tbelord wos oftenseen walking an the sea-shore, and he hcld bought her o piano-farte, and taught her himself the usc of it.\nSucb was the information wilh which we departed fr0m the peaceful islc of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, gvessing who this ramb1er in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geniuſ. Arrived at Palermo, alI our dovbts wcre dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupi1 of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greecc, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxiaus, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\" We had ncver then heard of hjs lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe HaraIde\" being put into our hands wc recognized the recluse 0f Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having 6een more curious in our rosearcheſ at thc cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on s0me future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, beljeving it not qujte uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly sIandered. He has beon described as of ori unfeeling disposition,averſe to aſsociating with humcln nature, or contri6uting in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverfe, as may be plainly gathercd srom these little anecdates. All thc finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his l0rdship's poems, ſcem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderness, sympatby, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting tho repose of solitude is an additional reason for markirig him cls a bcing on whose heart Religion hath set her seol, and ovcr whose head Benevolerice hclth thrown her mantle. No inan can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him os a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I d0 not assume a right to give an opjnion. Reports are evcr to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integri ty; and he who dares justify hiinſelf beforo thal awfultribunal where all mvst appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron'scharacter is worthy af his genius. To do good in secrot, and shun the world's applause, is the surost testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prjnter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "ground_truth": "A Tale.",
    "gemini_cleaned": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\n\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\n\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassavia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corpses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\n\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief balliff.\n\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\n\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,\nThy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\nThen ghastly haunt the native place,\nAnd suck the blood of all thy race;\nThere from thy daughter, sister, wife,\nAt midnight drain the stream of life;\nYet loathe the banquet which perforce\nMust feed thy livid living corse.\nThy victims, ere they yet expire,\nShall know the demon for their sire;\nAs cursing thee, thou cursing them,\nThy flowers are withered on the stem.\nBut one that for thy crime must fall,\nThe youngest, best beloved of all,\nShall bless thee with a father's name—\nThat word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\nYet thou must end thy task and mark\nHer cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark,\nAnd the last glassy glance must view\nWhich freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\nThou with unhallowed hand shalt tear\nThe tresses of her yellow hair,\nOf which, in life a lock when shorn\nAffection's fondest pledge was worn—\nBut now is borne away by thee\nMemorial of thine agony!\nYet with thine own best blood shall drip;\nThy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;\nThen stalking to thy sullen grave,\nGo—and with Gouls and Afrits rave,\nTill these in horror shrink away\nFrom spectre more accursed than they.\n\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmot, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\n\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\n\nTHE VAMPYRE.\n\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shown in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\n\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\n\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\n\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than those of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\n\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\n\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\n\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to portray on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\n\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\n\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\n\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His Lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\n\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inh-\nabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\n\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see.\"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\n\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\n\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same ivorying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\n\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his Lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postillions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching",

    "original_ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in lhe East. Among the Ar abians it appeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to lhe Greeks until ofter the establlfhrnent of Christianity; and it has only ossumed its presont form since the divisiori of the Latjn and Greek churohcs; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thot a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradua1ly increased, and formed the subjoct of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood 0f lhe young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with same sligbt variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and L0rraine, whcre the helief cxjstod, that vampyres nightly lmbibed o certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciatcd, loft their strength, arid speedily died of consuinptions; whjlst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their ueinſ became distended to such a stateof repletiori,as lo cause the blood to flow srom all the passages of their bodies, and even fram the very pores of tbeir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accourit of a particular case of vampyrjsm, which is stated to haue occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chlef and magistrates of lhe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, riarned Arnold Paul, had bcen heard to say, that,at Cass0via, on the frontiers of lhe Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid hlmself of the evil, by eating some os the earth out os the vampyre's grave, and rvbbing himself with his blood. This preoaution, however, did not p revent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, clboul twenty or thirty daysafter his death and bvrial, many persons complained of having been tormerited by him, and a deposilion was made, that four porsons had been deprived of life by hif attacks. To provent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposcd to be vsual in cases af vampyrism) frosh, and entirely free from corrvption, and emitting at the movth, n0se, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomcd remedy. A stake was driven entireIy through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is rep0rted to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they out osf his bead, 6urnod his body, and threw the ashesinto his grave. The same measures were adopted witb the corses of those persons wb0 bad proviously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in tbeir turn, become agents upon others who survived tbem.\nThe uriiversal helief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre beoomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate tbe subjoct of the presont obſervotions than any other inslance which covld be addvced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crimo committed whilst in existcncc, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie his inferna1 visitations solely to lhase beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whorn he was bound by tief of kindred and affectjon.—A supposition aIluded lo in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut flrſt on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from ils tomb be rent; Then ghostly haunl the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sjster, wife, At midnight draln the stream of lifo; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed tby livid livirig corse, Thy victims, ere tbey yol expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, tbou cursing them, Thy flowers are wjthered on the stem. Bvt onothal for thy crime mvst fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Sholl bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flaino! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's laslspark, And thelast glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhclllowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a look when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne awcly by thee Memorial os thine agony! Yet with thirie own best blood sbclll drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking lo thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in horror shrink away From spectre inore accurſed tban they.\nMr. Southcy hos also introduced in his wild but beautifulpoem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of tbo Arabian maid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned sram the grave for tbe purpose of tormenting bim she best loved wbilst in existencc. But thiſ cannot bo supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being paurtrayed throughovt the whole of the tale as a compIete type of purity arid innooence. The veracio us Tournefort gives a long account in bis travels of several astonishing eases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, and traditionary narratiues jllustrative of its esfects, has put fortb some learned dissertations, tending to prove it t0 be a classical, as well as borbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrihle superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, andwhich moy now be coricluded by merely remarking, that thougb the term Vampyre is the one in most generaI acceptation, there are severa1 others synonymous with it, made use of iri various parts of the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipationſ attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the Ieaders of the ton a nobleman, more remclrkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon lhe mirth around him, af if ho could riotparticipate thcrein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasls where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who selt this sensation of awc, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whjcb, fixing upon the objec t's face, did not seem to penetrale, ond at one gIarice to pierce thr0ugh ta the inward workings of the heart; but fell upan the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarjlies caused him to be invited to every housc; a1l wished to see him, and those wh0 had been accvslomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, wero pleaſed at having somothing in their preſence capclble of engclging their attcntion. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never galned a warmer tint, either from thc blush of modosty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline wore beautiful, many of the female bunters afler notorjety attempted to win his attontions, and gain, at least, some marks of whclt they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn jn drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did allbut put on the dress of a mountebank, ta attract his riotice:—though in vairi:—wheri she stood before him, though his eyes were apparontly fixed upan her's, still il seemed as if lhey were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence wasbaffled, and she left the fiold. But thovgh the common adultress could not influenceeven the guidance of his oyef, it was not that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet such was lhe apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, thal few knew he ever addressed hjmself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a win ning tongue; and whether it was tbat it even overcamo the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparont hatred of vice, he was as often among those femaleſ wh0 form the boast af their sex from their do mestic virtuos, asamong thosc who su1ly it by the ir vices.\nAbout the somo timo, there came to London a young gentlernan of the name of Avbrey: he was ori orphan 1eft with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alsolo himself by guardians, who thoughl it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquishod thc more important charge of bis mind to the cclre os mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imclgiriatlori than his iudgment. He had, hence, that hlgh romantic feeling of h0nour and candaur, which dai1y ruins so many milllriers' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque esfeet of the scene, af wo see in romances: he thought thal the inisery of a oottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, hut which were 6etter adclptod to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the drcams af poets were the realities of llfe. Ho was handsome, frank, ond rich: for these reasons, upon his enlering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded bim, slriving whlch should describe with least truth their lclriguishing or ramping favourltes: the davghters at the same ti me, 6y their brighteriing countenances when he approached, and by tbeir sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his ſolitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles tbat flickerod, nol from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snufsing, there was ria foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from wbich he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compenfation iri his gratified vanity, he was about to reIinquish his dreams, wheri tbe extraordinary being we have abaue deseribed, crossed bim in his career.\nHe watched him; and tho vory impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, who gave few 0ther sig nſ of his observation of external objects, thari lhe tacit assent t0 their exiſtence, imp1ied by the avoidance of their oontact: allowirig hjs imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soori formedthis objecl into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the perfon before him. He became acquainted wlth hlm, paid him attentions, and so far advanoed upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's asfairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from lhc notes of prcparation in — Street, that he was about to lrovel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this slngular cbaracter, who, till now, had only whetted bis curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations haf heen thought necessclry t0 enoble the young to take some rapid ſteps jn the caroer of vice towards putting themselvef upon an equallty with the aged, and not aIlowing them to appear as if folleri from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleafantry or of praise, occording to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. Thoy consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to jojn him. Flattered bysuch a mark of estecm from him, who, apparently, had notbing in common with otbcr men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed lhe circling waters.\nHilherto, Avbrey had had no opportunity of studying Lard Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions wereexposed to bis view, the results ossered different coriclusions from thc apparent motives lo his conduct. His compariion was profuse in his libercllity;—the idle, lhe vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hclnd morc than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avold remarking, that it was nat upon the vlrtuous, roduced to indigence by tbe misfortunes attendanl even up0n virtue, that ho bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardlysuppressed sneers; but when the profligale camo to afk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink hjm still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with ricb charity. This was, howevor, altributed by him to the greater imporlunity of thc vicious, which generally prevoils ovcr the retiring bashfulnesſ of the virtuous ind igenl. There waf one circumstance abovt the chari ty of his Lordship, whioh was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon wbom il was bestowed, inevitably found that there wasa curfe upon it, for they wereall either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and tbe moſt abject misery. At Brusfels arid other towns thr0ugh which lhey passed, Auhrey was surprjzed attho apparent oagerness with whjch his companion sought for the centres ofall fashionable vioe; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharpcr was his antagonist, and then he last even more than he gained; but it was always with the sclme unchanging face, with which he generally watchod the society around: it was not, however, fo when he encountered tbe rash youthful novioc, or the luckless father of a numer0us family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparerit abstractednefs af mind was laid clslde, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of tho cal whilst dallylng witb the balf-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude af a dungean, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of tbis fiend; whilst many a father sat fraritic, amidst the speakirig looks of mvte hungry children, without a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewjth to buy even suffloient t0 satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money srom lhe gambling tablc; but immcdiately lost, to the ruiner 0f many, the last gil der he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mig ht but be the result of a certain degree os knowIedge, which was nol, however, capable of combating the cunnirig os the more experjenced. Auhrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasure whioh proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity as speoking frankly and openly to him; however, this never ocourred. Lord Rutbven in hif carrioge, and amidst the varjous wild ond rich scenes of nature, was always the same: hiseye spoke loss than his lip; and though Aubrey was riear the object of bis curlosity, he obtained no greoter gratjfication from it than the constant excilement of vainly wishing to break that myſtery, whlch to his exalted imaginatiori b egan lo assvme the appearance of something supematvral.\nThey soon arriued at Rome, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendanee upon lhe morning circle of an Italian countoss, whilst he went in search of the inemorials of ariother almost deserted city. Whilst he was lhus engaged, letters orrived frorn England, which he opened with eager impatience; the fjrst was from his sister, breathing nothing hut affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter aslonished him; if it had besore entered into his lmagination that there was an evil power resident in his compani0n, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted up0n his immediately 1eaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possessian of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adullress had not originated in hatred of hor charact er; but tbat he had re quired, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of bis guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsulIied virtve, down to the lowest abyssos infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those femcl les wh0m he had sought, apparenlly on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and bad not scrupled to expose the whole defo rmity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose oharacter had not yet shown a single brig ht point on which to rest the eye. He resalued to invent some plausible pretext for a6andoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him mare closely, and to let no slight circumstanceſ pass by unnoticed. Heentered into the same circlo, and soon perceived, that his Lordship waf erideovouring to work upon the inexperience of the davghter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequerited. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmclrried female is met with in society; he was therofore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignatjon had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of on jnnocenl, though thougbtless girl. Losjng no time, he eritered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptlyasked him his intentions with respect to the lody, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his bejng about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answered, that hjs intentions were such aſ he svpp0sed all would haue upon suoh an occasion; and upan being pressed whetber he intended to marry her, m erely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immedialely writing a note, to say, that srom that moment be must decline accornpanying his Lordfhip in lhe remalnder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and callirig vpon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughlor, but also concerning the character of his Lordſhlp. The ofsignatian was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely senl his servanl to notify his camplete assent to a separation; but did nol hint any suspicion af his p1 anſ having beeri foiled by Aubrey's interpasitian.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stcps towards Greece, and crossing the Penirisula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence jn thc house of a Greek; and soon occupied biinself in tracing the faded rcc0rds of ancient glory upori monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chroniclirig the de eds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roos as himself, existed a beirig, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed thc model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hopo of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, savo thclt her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plairi, or tripped along tbe movntain's side, one would have thought thc gazelle a poor type of her bcauties; for who would have exchariged her oye, apparently the eye of onimated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the ariimal suited but lo the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncanſoious girl, engaged in the pursuit os a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind,to the eager gaze of him, wha forgot the letlers he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-1ike figure. Ofton would her tresses falling, as she flitted araund, exhibjt in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulnesf of the anliquary, wbo let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretatiori of a passage in Pausanias. Bvt why atleinpt to describe charms which al1 feel, but rione can appreciato?—It waſ innocence, youth, ond becluty, unaffccted by crowdeddrawing-rooins and stifling balls.Whilst hc drew those remains of which he wlshed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effeots of hjs penoil, in tracing the sccnes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circIjng dance upon the open plairi, wovld pairit, to him in all the glowing ealours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp ſhe rcmembered viewing in her lnfancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made cl greoler impression upon her mind, would tellhim all the supernatural tales os her nurse. Her earneftness and apparent 6elief of what she riarrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as sbe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upan the life of a love ly female to prolong his existenoe for the erisuing months, his blo od would run cold, whllst be attempted to laugh her out of such idle and borrible santasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old rnen, who had at last detected one living among lhemselves, after several of thoir ncar relatives and children bad been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hiin so ineredulous, she begged of him to believe her, far it had been, remarkod, that those who had daredto questlon their exifterice,always hcld somc pr0of given, which obliged them, witb grief and heartbreaking, to corifess it was true. She detaiIed to bim the traditiona1 appoarance of these monstcrs, and his horror waf increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; be, however, still persifted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same lime hc wondered at thc many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in lhe superriatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAubrey begcln to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted witb all the asfected virtues of the wornen am0ng whom he had sought for his vision0f romance, won bis heart; arid whiIe he ridicv1ed the idea of a young rnan of Eriglish habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost sairy form bef0re him. He wou ld tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to retu rn unlil his object was attained; but be always found it impossible to fix his atteriti0n upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retairied an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughls. Ianthe was unconscious of hjs love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemod to part from bim with reluctancc; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could vis it her favourite havnts,whilst her guardian was ocoupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which hod yct escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to herparents onthe subject of Vampyres, and they bolh, wlth seueral present, affirmed their existence, pa1e with horror at the very name. Soon a ster, Aubrey determiried to proceed upon one of his oxcursions, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they hcard the namc of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek w0uld ever re main, after the day had closed, upon any consideratlon. Thoy described it as tbe resort of lhe uompyres jri their nocturrial orgies, and dcnounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon him wh0 dclred to cross their palh. Aubrey made light of their representotions, and tried to laugh thcm out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set oss upon his excurfion unattended; he was surprised to observe tho melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to fjnd that his wards, mocklng tbe belief of those horrible fjends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about lo depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnesl1y beggod of him to returri, ere riight allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he promjsed. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that be did not perceive that doy-lighl would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one af those specks which, in the warmer climcltes, so rapid1y gather into a tremeridous mass, and pour all their rclge upon the dovoted country.—He ot last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by speed for his delay: but it waſ too late. Twilight, in these southern climateſ, is almost unknown; immedlcltely the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders bad scarcely an iriterval of rest—its tbick heavy rairi forced its way through the canopying foliage, whi1st the blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took frjght, ond he was carried with dreadful rapidity tbrough the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fat-\niguc, stoppod, and he found, 6y lbe glare of lightning, that he was in the neighhourhood of a hovel that hardly liftcd itself up from the mafses of dead leaues and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he opproached, hop ing to find ſome one to guidc him tothe town, or at least trusling to obtainshelter from the pclting 0f lhe ftorm. As he approclched, the thunders, for a mo ment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, c ontinued in 0ne almost unbroken sovnd;—he was startled: but, roused by tbe tbunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a fudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He fovnd himself iri utter darkness: the sourid, however, gujded him. He was apparently unpereeived; for, though he ealled, still the sourids continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himsolf in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and be feIt himself grappled by one wh0se strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his lise as dear1y as he could, be struggled; hut it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enorm0us force against the ground:—his enemy threw himsclf upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when lho glare of many torohes penetrating through tbe hole that gaue light jn the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leavlng his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the cra ſhing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. Tho storin was now slill; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard 6y those without. They entered; the light of their torches fe1l upon the mud walls, and the thatch laadod on evcry individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire os Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was ogain left in darkncss; bvt what was his horror, when the light of thc torches once in0re burst upon him, to percejve the airy f0rm of his fair conductrefs broughl in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it wos bvt a vjsion arising from hjs disturbed imaginalion; but ho agairi saw the same form, whcn he unclosed them, stretched by hiſ side. There was no colovr upon her cheek, not even upon ber lip; yet lhore was a stillness about her faco thal seemed almost as attaching as tho life that once dweIt there:—upon her rieck and breast was hlo0d, and upon her throatwere the rnarks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horrar, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A 1itter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the sideof her wbo had lately been to him the obj ect of so many bright and fairy vislons, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what bis thoughts w ere—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held olmost vnconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a pa rticular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been ongclged in the search of her whom a mother hadmissed. Their lamentable crics, as they approached thc city, forewarned theparents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossib le; but wheri they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corfe. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrcy being put to 6ed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in thefe intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by someunaccountable combination he ſeemed to beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he wauld imprec ate ma1edictions upori his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanocd at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motivc, vpon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hjmseIf in the same h0use, and became his constant atlendant. When the lattcr recovered from his deljrium, hc was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had riow combined with that 0f o Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance f0r tbe foult that bad caused their separati0n, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he sbowed, soon reconoiled him to bis presence. His lordship seemcd quite changed; he no longer clppeared thclt apathetic being who hod so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no differerice from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gclze fixed intently upan him, with a smile of malicious exullationplaying upon his lips: he knew not wby, but this smile haunted him. During the laft stage af lhe invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was appareritly ongaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling bree2e, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, tbe moveleſs sun;—indeed, he clppeared to wish to avoid thc eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was mvch weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whicb had once so distinguisbed him now seemed to have flod for ovor. He was now as much a lover of solitude and si1ence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, bis mind could nol find it in the neighb0urhood of Athens; jf he sought it amidst the ruins he bad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he soughl it in the woods, her light step w0uld appear wandering amidst thc underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly lurning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale fclce and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile uponher lips. He determjned to fly scenes, every feature of wbjch created suchbitler asfociations iri his mind. He proposod to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himsolf bound by the lerider care he had taken of him during his illness, that tbey should visit those parts ofGreeoe neither hod yet seen. They travelled in cvery direction, and fovght every spot t0 which a recollection could be attached: but tbough they thus hastened from place to place, yet they soemed not to heed whclt they gazed upon. They heard much of r0bbers, but they gradually began to sl ight thefe reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest jt was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus neglecting lhe advice of tho inbabitants, on one occasion they lravelled withonly a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a dosenco. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whioh was the bed of a torrent, with lclrge masses os rock brought down from the noighbo-\nuring preciplees, they bad reaſon to repenl their negligence; for scarcely wero the whole of the party engaged in the narr0w pass, when they were stortled by the whistling of bullets cIose to their heads, and by the eehoed report of several guns. In an instant thejr guards had left tbem, and, placing themselves hehind rocks, had begun to fire jn the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven ond Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turri of thc defile: bvt ashamed of being thus detalned by a foe, who wjth insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposedto unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb ab0ve and take them in tbe rear, they determined at onoe to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven reccived a ſhot in the shoulder, which 6rought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heedirig the c0ntest or his own peril, was s0on surprised by seeing tbe robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and svrrendered.\nBy promjses of great reward, Aubrey soon induced tbem toconvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring ca6in; and having agreed upon a ransom, hc was no more distvrbed by tbejr presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrclde should return with the promised sum, for which he had cln order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days morliflcati0n ensuod, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconseious of pain as he bad beeri of the objects about him: but towards the clase oftbe laft evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye ofton fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earneflness—\"Assist me! y0u may save me—you may do more thari that—I mean not my life, I heed thc death ofmy existerice as littIe as tbat of the passing day; but yav may save my hanour, your friend's hon0ur.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my lise ebbs apace—I cannot oxplain the whole—but if you would concool all yov know af me, my honour were free from ſlain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but lifo.\"—\"It shall not bo known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself wjth exultant vio-\nIcnce, \"Swear by all your saul reueres, by all your naturo fears, swear that, for a year and aday you will not impart your kn0wledge of my crimes or death to any living boing in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from lheir sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laugbing upon his pillow,and brcathod rio more.\nAubroy retired ta rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintancc with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivorlng came ovcr him, as if from the presontiment of something horrible awaiting bim. Rising early in tbe m0rning, hewas about to enter the hovel in which he had lest the corpse, when a robber methim, and infarmod him thal it was na langer there, having been conveyed by himsolf and cainrades, upon his retiring, to lhe pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his deoth. Aubrey astonished, and tclking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upan the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he f0und no trace of eithcr the corpse or the clothes, thougb the robb ers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they hadlaid the body. For a time his mind wasbewildered in conjectures, but he at last retvrned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the soke of the clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had met with ſuch terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparontly conspired to heightcn lhat superstitious melanch0ly thal had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst olher thi ngs there was a case coritaining several weclpons of offerice, more or less adaptedto ensure tbe death of the vlctim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning thcm over, arid examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the samo style aſ the dagger discovered in the falal hut—he shuddcred—hasteriing to gainfurther proof, be found lhe weapon, and hishorror may be imagined when be difcovered that it fitted, though peculiar1y shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed t0 need no fvrther certainly—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room sor doubt; thore wcre also drops of bl0od on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on hiſ way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seduclivc arts. Her parents werc iri distress,their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard 0f since the departure of his lordſhip. Aubroy's mind beoamo almost broken under so many repealed horrors; he was afraid that lhis lady bad fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhc. He became morofe and silent; and his only occupation c0nslsted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were golng to savo the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wi11, ſoon wafted hiin to the English shores; and be hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and thcre, for a moinent, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, a1l memory of tho past. If she before, by her infantine carosses, had gained his affectjon, now that the woman begon to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey had not tbat wln nlng grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There wcls noneof that light brillioncy which only existf in the healed atmospberc of a crowded aparlment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the leuity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which djd not seem to arise fram misfortune, but from some feeljng wilbin, that appeared to indicate a s0ul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays whero'er a butterflyor a co1ovr mcly atlract—it was sedateand pensive. Wben alone, her face was never brightened 6y the smile of j0y; bul when her brother breathed to her hls afsection, and wauld in her pre-\nsence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchangcd her smile for lhat of the voluptuary? It scemed as if those eyes,—lhat sace were then playing in the light of their own nativo sphere.She was yet only eighte-\nen, and had not been presented ta the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should bo delayed until her brother's retum from lhe continent, wben hc might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved thattbo next drawing-room, which was fast approoching, should be the epoch of her entry into lhe \"bvsy fcene.\" Aubrey would rather have remai ned in lhe manslon of bis fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not foel interest ab0ut the srivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so torn by the evenls he had witnesſed; but he determined to sacrificc his 0wn oomfort lo the proteetion af his sister. They soon clrrived in t0wn, and preparod for tho next day, which had been clnnounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and aIl who were anxi-\nouſ to bask inthe smile of royalty, hastencd tbither. Aubrey was there with his sistcr. Whi1e he was stonding in a oorner by himself, beedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly selzed by the arm, and a voice ho recognizcd too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to tum, feclrful of seeing a spectre that would 6last bim, when he peroeived, at a little distance,lhe same figure which had clttraeted his notice on this spot upon his first entry lnto saciety. He gazed till hiſ limbs alm0st refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take thearm of a friend, and forcing a pasſage through the crowd, be threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his handſ upori his head, as if he were af raid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthvon again before him—oircumstarices started up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imaginatian hod oonjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, thereforo, to go again int0 society; sor though ho attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he oould not succeed in gaining information. He went a sew nights after with his siſter to the asſembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired inlo a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devauring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and eritering ariother room, faund his sister surrounded by several, apparenlly in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he rcquested lo move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He fprang forword, soized his sistcr's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced her towards the s treet: at the door he found himself impoded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voiee whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reachcd home.\nAubrey became almast distracted. If 6efore his mind had been absorbed by one svbject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now lhat the certainty of the monster's livjng again pressed upon his thovghtf. His sistcr's attentions were now unheeded, and il waſ in vain that she intreatod him to explain to her what hod caused his abrupt conduct. He only vttered a few words, and thosc terrified her. The more he thought, the more be was bewildered. His oath stortled him;—waf he then to ollow this monstcr to roam, bearing rvin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions,who would 6elieve him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he reinembered, had been already m0cked. For dayſ he remairied in this ſtate; shvt up in hiſ room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister come, wbo, with eyef streaming with tears, besought him, f0r her sake, to support riature. At last, no longer oapahle of bearing stillnessand solitude, be lest his houfe, roamcd from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected,and he wa ndered, as often exposed t0 the noon-day sun as to the inidnight damps. He was no 1onger to be recogriized; at first hc returned with the evening to the house; but at laſl be laid him down to rest whereuer fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxjous for his safety, employed people t0 follow him; but tbey were saon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, h0wever, suddenly ehanged. Struck with tbe idea that he left by his absence the wholc of his frierids, with a fiend amongst them, of wh0se presence thoy were unconscious, he determined to enler again into society, and watch him closely, anxiaus to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Rutbven approached with intimacy. But when he entered int0 a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were s0 striking, hif iriward shudderings so visible, thathis sjster wos at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, for ber sake, cl society which affectcdhim so strongly. When, bowever, rem0nstrance proved uriavailing, lhe guardiansthought proper to interpose, and, feoring lhat his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high tirne to resume again that trust which had been before impofed upan lhem by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reſide in the housc, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by ono terrible subject. His incoherence became clt last so great, thot he was confined to his chamher. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had became emaciated, his eyes had attained a gIassy lvstre;—the only sjgn of affection and recollection remaining displayed itſelf upon tho entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, ond, seizing her hands, with l ooks that severcly afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh,do not touch bim—if your I0vc for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, howover, she inquired l0 whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and agaln be sank jnta a state, whence not even sbe could rouſe him. This lclsted many months: gradually, howevcr, as the year was passing, his incoherences became loss frequent, and hif mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that severa1 times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smilc.\nThe time had noarly elapsed, when, upon the last dayof the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began ta converse with his physiciari upon tbe melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's bcing in so awful cl siluation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instanlly Aubrey's attentlon was attracted; he asked anxiovsly to whom. Glad of this mark 0f reluming jritollect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking tbis wos a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleafed, and astonished thom still moreby his expressing his intenlion to be present at the nuptials, and dcsiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes hls sister was with him. Hc was apparently again capable os being affected by the irifluonce 0f her lovely fmile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the lhaught of ber brotber's being onco moro alive to the feeIings of affcctjon. He began to speak wilb all his w0nted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; operiing it, what was his surprise at beholding the features os the monstor who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait lna poroxysm af ragc, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her askirig him why he thus dostroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing hcr hands, arid gazing on her witb a frantic expression of countenance, be bade her ſwear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not cldvance—jt seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, lhinking Lord Ruthveri was near bim butsaw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard tbe whole, and thought this was but a roturn of his disorder, entered, and f0rcing him from Miss Au6rey, defired her to leave him. He fell upori his knees lo them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, clttributing this to the in sanity they imagined had taken possession os his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvcri had calIed the morning after the drawing-room, and had 6een refused with euery one else. When he hoard of Aubrey's ill hea1th, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned thot he was deemed irisane, his exultatjon and pleasure could bardly be concealed from those am0rig wh0m he had gained this information. He hclstened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attcndance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradualIywon lhe ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resiſt his powcr? Hjs tangue had dangers and toils t0 recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy wlth any being ori lhe crowded earth, save with her to whom headdressed himſelf;—could tell how, since he knew hcr, his existerice, had begun to seem worlhy of preservation, if it were mcrcly that he might listen to her foothing accents;—in sine, he knew fo well how to use theserpent's art, or such wcls the will of fate, that he gained her asfections. The title of tho elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important einbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in splte of her brother's deranged state,) which waſ lo take p1ace the very day hefore his doparture for lhe continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physieian and his guardians, attempted t0 bribe the servants, 6ut in vain. He asked for pen arid paper; it was gjven him; he wr ote a lelter to his sister, oonjuring her, as sbe valued her own happinesf, ber own hon0ur, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as tbeir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sorvants promised they would deljvor it; but giving it to the physici an, he th0ught it better nol to harass any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he corisidered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on witbout rost to the buſy inmates of the h0use; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notos of busy preparation. Morriing came, and the sound of carrjages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frclntic. The curiosity of the servaritſat last overcame th eir vigilance, they gradually stole clway, leoving him in the cuftody of an belpless old wornan. He seized the opporturiity, with one bourid waf out of the room, and in a moment found hjinself in the apartment where a1l were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the fjrst to perceive him: hc imrnediately opproached, and, taking his arm by forco, hurriod him from the room, speechless witb rage. Whon on the stair case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remembor your 0ath, arid know, if nat my bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So ſaying, he pushed hjm towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in searcb ofhim. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not fin ding vont, had broken a blood-uessel, ond he was convcyed to hed. This was n0t mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he eritered, os the pbysician was afraid of agitclting her. The marriage was salemnjzed, and the bride and bridogroom lefl London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood pr0duced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guclrdians might beoalled, and when the midnight hour had strvck, he related camposedly what theroclder has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it waf too late. Lord Ruthven hod djsappeared, and Aubrey's sisler had glvtted the thlrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, C0NTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE,&c.\n\"The world wcls aIl 6efore bim, where to choose his placc of rest, arid Providence hjs guide.\"\nIN Sailjng throvgh the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vesself, in the year 1812, we put irito the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certairi supply of cattle and vegelables always to be bad lhero, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and rnerchontmen; and th0ugb it lies rather out of the track for ships bound lo Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation os a voyage. We laridcd; as usual, at tho bottom of tbe bay, and wbilst the men were emp1oyed in watering, and the purser bargaining for catt1o with thenatives, thc clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been befare. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticulc so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our gulde, who told uſ he had come from Scio with an Engliſh lord, who left the iſland four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho ongagcd me as a pilot,\" soid the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choosc to quit Mitylene, where I arn likely to get married. He was an odd, hut a very good man. Tbe cottage ovcr tbe hill, facing the river, belongs to hiin, and he has lest an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there a6out fourteen months, though not conſtantly; for he sailf in his felucca very often to the different islclnds.\"\nThiſ accaunt excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kjndly receiued by an old man, wh0 conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four aparlments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawirig-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spaciaus closet annoxed. They were all simply decorated: plain greeri-stained walls, marble tables 0n either side,a large myrtle jn the centre, and a small fountain beneoth, whicb could be made to play thr0ugh the branches by moulng a spririg fjxed in the side os a srnall bron2e Verivs iri a leanirig p0sture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dazen English carie chairs, and an empty book-ease: there were no mirrors, nor a singlepainting. The bedchomber had merely a large mattress spread on the floar, with two stuffed cotton quilts and o pillow—the commori hed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed cl rnarble recess, formerly, theald man told us, filled with b0oks and papers, which were tben in a large feaman's chest in tbe claset: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exclmining the eontents. On the tabIet of the reeess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roufseau's warks compIete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in tbe German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzobue's n0vels; Schiller's play of the Rabbers;Milton's Paradisc Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in I81o; several small pamphlets from tho Greek prefs at Constantinople, much torn, but no Englifb book of any description. Mosl of tbese books wero filled with marginal notes, wrjtten with a pencil, inItalian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, arid marked with sllps of papor, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been readirig these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otherf; but,\" said he, \"lhere they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing withoul orders, ho would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwayf very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of thls farm for the trouble of tclking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottagc in the waod, clnd whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; Idon't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the hovse externally wos pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen braad, ond the fluted m arble pillars wilh black plinths and fret-work corriices, (as it is now custamary in Grecian architecture,) were considerabIy higher than tbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was couered by a fine Tvrkey carpel, benealh an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houſe-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings iri sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frvit, and enjo ying lhc evening breeze.\nOn the lest hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapcs, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the sha de os two large m yrtle bushes, a marhle seat wilh an ornamental wooden back was placed, on whlch we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said lhe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twlce a week, besides Sundays.\"\nTho vicw from this seat was whal may bo termed \"a bird's-eyo view.\"A linc of rich vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with ollve and myrtle trees in bloorn, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple app eared in mcljestio deeay. A small stream issving from the ruins descended in broken cascadcf, untll it was lost in the woods near thc mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a l jttlc on the 1oft, lhrough a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several fmallis1ands were distinctly observed, stvddirig the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominlok, his banker, whohad gone toCandia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conduotor, \"could tcll, but I am furc he will not,\"—\"And carinot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said hc, \"I dare nol.\" We hod not tiine to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnl several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had portioncd eight young girls when he was last upan tbe island, and even danced with them at tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotlon and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bougbt a new hoat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamen ts to the poor chiIdren. In short, he appe-\nared to us, from all we callected, to have been a very eccentric and benevoIent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our 0ld friend at the cottage tbought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughtor, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-sorte, and taught hcr himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from thepeaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginalions all on the rack, gucssing who thjs rambler in Groece could be. He had money it was evident: he had phi1anthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, aIl our doubtſ were dispelled. Falling in company witb Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" sald he, \"about wham you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited hlm at Milylene.\" We bad riever thcri heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years fr0m home; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calclcl in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with lhe idea of retvrning to Milylone on same future day; bul to me thclt day will never return. I make this statemerit, believing it not quite unintereſting, and in juſtice to bis lordship's good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as 0f an unfeeling dispoſiti0n, averse toassoeiating with human nature, or contributing inany way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is djreotly the reverse, as may bo plairily gathered from those little anecdotes. All tbe finer feelirigs of the heart, so elegant ly dopicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seot in his bosom. Tenderness, sym-\npathy,and charity appear to guide oll his actions: and hjs courting tbe repose of s0litude is an addjtional reason for marking him as o being 0n whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read thepreceding pleasjng \"traits\" withovt fceling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or p1eclsures, I do not assume a right to give on opinion. Reports are ever to be received with coution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsclf before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius.

    "gemini_cleaned": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\n\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\n\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corpses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\n\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\n\nChief bailiff.\n\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\n\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,\nThy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\nThen ghostly haunt the native place,\nAnd suck the blood of all thy race;\nThere from thy daughter, sister, wife,\nAt midnight drain the stream of life;\nYet loathe the banquet which perforce\nMust feed thy livid living corse,\nThy victims, ere they yet expire,\nShall know the demon for their sire;\nAs cursing thee, thou cursing them,\nThy flowers are withered on the stem.\nBut on one all for thy crime must fall,\nThe youngest, best beloved of all,\nShall bless thee with a father's name—\nThat word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\nYet thou must end thy task and mark\nHer cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark,\nAnd the last glassy glance must view\nWhich freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\nThen with unhallowed hand shall tear\nThe tresses of her yellow hair,\nOf which, in life a look when shorn\nAffection's fondest pledge was worn—\nBut now is borne away by thee\nMemorial of thine agony!\nYet with thine own best blood shall drip;\nThy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;\nThen stalking to thy sullen grave,\nGo—and with Gouls and Afrits rave,\nTill these in horror shrink away\nFrom spectre more accursed than they.\n\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\n\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\n\nTHE VAMPYRE.\n\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eye, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\n\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or rampant favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\n\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\n\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\n\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\n\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\n\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always held some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\n\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\n\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\n\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\n\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\n\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant vio-\nlence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see.\" —His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\n\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\n\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\n\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear",
