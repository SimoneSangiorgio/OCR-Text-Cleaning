    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHEsuperstition upon which this taIe iſ founded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabjans itappeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establi shment of Christianity; and it has only aſsumed its prosent form since the division af the Latin and Greok churches; at which time, lhe idea becoming prevalent, that a Lcltin body could not corrvpl if buried in their territory, it gradually increosed, and formed lhe subject of many wonderful stories, ſtill extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding uponlhe blood of tho young and beautiful. In the West itspread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whoro the helies existed, that vompyresnightly imbi6ed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of c0nsumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of ropletion, as t0 cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their badies, and even fr0m the ucry pores of thoir skins.\nIn theLond0n Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiovs, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to hove accurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief arid magistrates of tbe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had bcen beclrd to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the fr0ntiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euj1, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing himſelf with his blood. This prccaution, however, did not prevent him from bccoming a vampyre himſels; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complainod of hauing 6een tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived os life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the lnhabitants havjng consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and f ound it (aſ is supposed to be usual in cafes of uampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the rnouth, riose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely lhrough the bearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hauecried out cls dreadfully as is he had been olive. This done, they cut ofs his head, burned his body, and threw lhe asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of th ose persons who had previously dicd from varnpyrism, lest they should, in theirturn, become clgentf upan others who survived them.\nThe universa1 belief js, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, arid sucks in his turn.\nChlef bai1iff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems betler adapted to illustrate the subject of the prcsent o6servations than any other iristance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of pvnishment after doatb, for some hein ous crime commjtted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not anly doomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine bis infernal vjsitations solely to thofe beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom be was bound by ties of kindr od and affeclion.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut firſt on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corſe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natiue place, And suck thc blo0d of all thy race; There srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet l0atbe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living corſe,Thy victims, ore they yet expirc, ShaIl know the demon for tbeir fire; As cvrſing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime musl fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flaine! Yel thou must end thy task and inark Her c heek's last tinge—hor eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freozes o'er its lifeless b1ue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock wheri sborn Affcction's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of lhine agony! Yet with thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then sta1king to thy sullen gravc, Go—arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrjnk away From spcctre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey hcls also intraduced in his wild bul heavtiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vompyre corfe of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as havirig returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hirn shc best loved whilst in exiſtence.Bvt this cannot be supposed to havc resulted from the sinfulneſs of her life, she being pourtrayed througbout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciouſ Tourncf0rt gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his greot work upon this subject, besides avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of jts effects, has put forth ſome learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errar.\nMany curious and intcresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; tbough the present may suffiee for the limjts of a note, neceſsarily devoted to explanation, and which inay now be conc1uded 6y merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, thcre are scvercll others synonymous withit, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the variovs partles af lhe leaders of the ton anobleman, inore rcmarkable for his singularitjes, thcln his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where th0ughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe,could nat cxplajn whencc it arose: some attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object's face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim t0 be invited to every bou fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight af en nui, were pleased at having somelhing in their preserice capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue 0f his foce, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passiori, lhough its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc fcmale hunters after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who bad been tbe mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms ſince her marriage, threw herse1f in his way, and did all but put an the dress of a mauntebank, to attract his not ice:—thoughin vain:—when fhe stood before him, though his eyes were apparonlly fixed upon her 's, ſtill it seemed as lf they were unperceived;—evcn her unappalled iinpudonce wcls baffled, and she left the fiold. But though the comm0n adultress could not inflvence everi the guidancc of hiſ eyos, it was not that tbe female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whelher it was that it even ouercarne the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females who form the boast of thejr sex from their domestic virtues, as amang thoſe who sully it by their vices.\nAhout the ſame time, there cclme to Lond0n a yourig gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet jn childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it tbeir duty merely to take care of hls fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind lo tbe care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than hiſ judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the vcsting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to tho painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, jn sine, that the dreams os poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and rieh: for lhese reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers svrrounded bim,striving which shovld describe wlth least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daug-\nhterſ at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whenbo opened his lips, s0on led him into false notions of his talenls and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram ance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax cclndles that flickered, not from the presencc of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in recll life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from whjch he had formed his study. Fjnding, however, some compensati0n in bis gratified vanity, he was aboul to reliriqvishhis dreams, when the extraordinary belng we have above dcscrjbed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tbe vory impossibility of forming an idea of the charocler af a man entirely absorbed in himself, wh0 gaue few other signs of hif obseruation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of tbeir contact: allowing his irnagination t0 picture every thlng that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object inta the ber0 of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather thanthe persori besore him. He became acqv ainted with him, paid him atteritions, and so sar advanced upon his notice, that his presenco was alwoys recagnised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affoirs were embarrafsod, and soon found, from the notes of preparatlon in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirouſ of gaining some informalion respeeling this ſirigular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, thot il was time for him to perform the taur, which for many gerierations has been tbougbl necessary to enoble lbe yaung to take some rapid steps in the career of uice towards putti ng themselves upon an equality with the oged, and not allowing them to appear as if falleri froin the skies,whenever scaridalovs intrigues are mentloned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pralse, accordlrig to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning bis intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla-\nttered by such a mark of estcem frorn him, who, apparently, had nolhing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed lhe circling waterf.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and n0w he fovnd, that, though many more of bis actians were exposed to his viow, the results offered different concluslons from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse ln his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, reeeived from his hand more thari enough to relieve their immediale wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, lhat it was not upon the virluous, redvced ta iridigence by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuc, thal he beslowed his cllms;—these were sent from lhe door with hardly suppressed sneers; 6ut when thc profligate carne lo ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in hjs lust, or to sink him sti1l deeper in his iniquily, he was sent away with rich charity. This wos, howover, attributedby him to the greater importunity of tho vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was ono circumstance about the charity 0f his Lordship, which was stlll more lmpresfed up0n his mind: all lhose upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found thot therewas a curse vpon it, for they were all either led to the seaffaId, or sunk to the lowest and the most abjcct mjsery. At Brussels and othcr t owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparent eagerness with whieh his companion sought for the eentres of all fashionable vicc; there he entered jnto allthc spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari he gainod; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so wben he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckleſs fclther of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law—this apparent abstracledness of mind wcls Iaid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left tbe formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, curſing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reaeh os this fiend; wbilst many a father sat fraritic, clmidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immenſe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fcltisfy thelr present craving. Yet ho took no money from thc gambling table; bvt immediatoly lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the more exp-\nerienoed. Aubrey often wisbed to represent tbjſ to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl, and dld not terid to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, tbis never occurrcd. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: hiſ eye spoke less than his lip; and thougb Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of voinly wishing to break tbat rnyſtery, which t0 his exalted imagination bcgan to assumo the appearance of something svpernalural.\nThey s0on arrived ot Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendarice upon the morning circlc of an Italian countess, whilst he wenl in search of the memorials of another almost desertod cily. Whilst he waſ thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first wos from his sister, breathing nothirig but affection; lhe others were from his gvardians, the latter astanished him; if it had hesore entered into his imagination that thcre was an evil power resident in his companion, these soemed to glve hjm sufficienl reason f0rthe belief. His guardians jnsisted upon his immedialely leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresjstible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discouered, that his contempt for the a dultress had not originated in hatred of hercharacter; but thot he had reqvired, to erihance his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, shovld be hurled from the pinnclcIe of vnsullicd virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and dogradation: in fine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, hod, since his departvre, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to tbe public gaze.\nAubrey detcrmined upon leaving one, whose cbclracter had not yet shown a sjngle bright point on which t0 rest tbe eye. He refolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, ond to let no slight circurnslances pass by unnotlced. He entered into the ſame cir cle, and soon percoived, that his Lordship was ondeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldam that an unmarried female is met with in socjety; he was theref0re obliged to oarry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fallowedhim in all his windingf, and soon diseoverod that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, whlch would mosl likely ond in tho ruin af an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked hiin his intenlions wlth respect to the lady, informing him atthe same time that be was aware of his being about to meet her thal uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his inlentions were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon b eing pressed wbether he intended to marry her, merely laughcd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram that moment he must declirie accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he orderod his servarit to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho rnother of the lady, inf orined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sont hiſ scrvant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion ofhis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving lest Rome, Aubrey djrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the housc of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of anclent glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling thc deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soil or many co1oured lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, exlsted a being, so beautiful and delicate, thal she might have sormed the model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on carivass tbe promised hope osthe saithful in Mahomet's parcldise, savothat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plajn, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof hcr becluties; for who would have exchangcd hcr eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurlous look of the animaI suited but to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, sloatirig as it were upon the wind, to thc eager gazc of him, who forgot lhe letters he had jvst decypbcred upori an almosl effaced ta6let, in the contemplation of her sylph-Iike figure. Oflen would her tresses falIing, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s un's ray such delica tely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who lel escape from his mirid the very objecl he had before thaughl of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preseruo a memorjaI for hls future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all thc glowing colours af youthsul memory,the marriage pomp ſhe remernbered viewing in her irifancy; and then, turning to subjoctsthat had evidentIy madc a greater impreſsion upon her mjnd, would tell him all the superriatural talcs of her nurse. Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narratod, excited tho interest even of Aubrey; and oftenas she told him the tale of the living uampyre, wha had passed years amidst his fricnds, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upon tbe life of a lovely semalc to prolong his existerice for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst be attempted to laugh her out of such id1e and horrible fantasles; but Ianthe citedto him the riames os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children hod been found marked with lhe stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hirn so incredulous, she begged of him to bclieve her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, alwayſ had some proof giveri, which obljged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to con fess it was trve.She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters, and hjs horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven; he, hawevcr, ſtill persisted in persuclding her, that thore could 6e na truth in her fears, though at the same tirne he wondcred at the mariy coiricidencos which had all tended to excjte a belief in tho supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.\nAubrey began to attoch himself more clnd more to Ianthe; her innoeence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtues of the women among whom he had sovght f0r bis visiori of romance, won his heart; and whlle he ridjculed the idca of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found hiinself m0re and more ottachod to lhe almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ottimes fr0m her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wos attained; but he always fourid it lmpofsible to fix his attention upori the rvins around him, whi1st in his mind he retained an irnoge that seemed aIone the rightful possessor of his tboughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insantile being he had first known. She always seemed to pclrt from him witb roluclarice; but it was becaufe she had rio longer any one with whom sbe could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragmenl which bad yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeaIed ta her parents on the subject of Vampyres, andthey both, with sevcr al prefent, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursionſ, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they beard the name of the pla ce, thoy all at once be gged of him not to retvrn at night, as he must nocessarily pasf through a wood, where noGreek would ever remain, aster the day bad closed, vpon any conſideration. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced lhe most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey rnade light of their representations, and tried to lavgh them out of lhe idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his darjng thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he wos silent.\nNext m0rriing Aubrey set off upon his exoursian unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to sind lhat his words, mocking the bolief of those horri6le fiends, had lnspired them with fuch terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged os him to returri, ere night allowed the power os these boirigs to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, thal he did not perceive tbat doy-light would soon ond, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer cllmates, so rapidIy gather into a tremendous mass, and paur aIl their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, determined to mako up by speed for his delay: hut it waf too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost vnknown; immediate1y tho sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wclf above—lts echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliago, whilst thc blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hiſ uery feet. Suddenly his horse toak srighl, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity througb the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, clnd he found, 6y the glare of lightning, that he was iri the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead lcaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approachcd, hoping to find some one to guide him to the t0wn, or at lcast trusting to obtain sheltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, fora moment silenl, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery os a laugh, contjnued iri one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced operi the door os the hut. He f0und himsclf in utter darkness: the sound, h0wever, guidedhim. He was apparently vnperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of bim. He found himself in c0n tacl with some one, whom he jmmediately ſeized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" t0 which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his Iife cls dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hisbreast, had pIaced bis hands upon his thraat—when thc glare of mony torches penetrating through the hole thclt gave light in the day, disturbod him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cl momenl the crasbirig of the branches, as he broke throvgh the wood, was rio longer heard. Thc st0rm was now stiIl; and Aubrey, incapable os moving, was soon heard by those wilbout. They entered; tbe light of their torches fell upon the mvd wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what waf his horror, when the lighl of tbe torches once mare burst upon hiin, to perceive the airy form of hls fair conductress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was 6ut a visjon arisirig from hls disturbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet th ere was a stillness abaut her foce that seemed almost as ottaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simvltaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickIy formed, and Au6rey waslaid by the side of her who had lately been to him thc objeot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had dled within her. He knew nol whot his thoughts were—his mirid was benumbed and seemcd to shun reflection, and take refvge in vacancy—he held almast uriconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constrvction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engagedjn the search of ber wham a mother had missod. Their lamcntable cries, cls they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. —To describe their grlef would be impossible; but whenthey ascertained the cause 0f their child'f death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointcd to the corse. They were inconsolable; botb died br0ken-hearted.\nAubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most vialent fever, and was often delirjovs; intheſe intervals he would ea1l upori Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe—hy some unaccountable combination he seemed la beg of his former compclnion to sparo the being hc loved. At other times he would imprecote maledictionsupon his head, and curse him as her destrayer. L0rd Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive al Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, andbecame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrisjed and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now com6ined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his klnd words, iinplying cllmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care whichhe showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quile changed; he na longer appeared that apathetic being who had ſo astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his eonvalescerice began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon hirn, wilh a smi1e of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smilo hau-\nntcd him. During the last ſtage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was clppclrently engaged in watohing the tideless waves raised by the cooling breozo, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, 1ike our world, the moveless fun;—lndeed, he appeared to wish to av0id tbe eyef of all.\nAubrcy's mind, by this sbock, was much weokened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of ſolitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind couId nat find it in tbe neighbourhood of At hens; if he sought it amidsl the ruins hehad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in tbe woods, her light step would appear wandering amldst the underwood, jn quest of the m0dest violet; then sudderily turning rovnd, would show, to hls wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. Ho determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crcated such bitter associcltions in hif mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he heId himself bound hy the tender cclre he had taken af him during his illness, that tbey sbouId visit those parts of Greecc neilher had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to whicb o recollectjon covId be attaohed: but thougb they thus haslened from place to place, yet they seomed not ta heed what they gazed upon. Tbcy heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to slight thesc reports, which they jmagined were only the invention of individvals, whosc interest it was to excite the generosily of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus rieglceting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasiori they travellcd with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torront, wilh large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiees, they had reason t0 repent their negligence; for scarccly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the cchoed report of sevcral guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placirig themselves behind rocks, had hegun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their exarnple, retired for a moment behjnd the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting fhouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the r0bbers should climb above and take lhom in the rear, they determlned at once to rush forward jn search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contcst or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, imrnediately thrown up their arms and surrendored.\nBy promises of greal reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded fricnd to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the pr0mised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's ſtrengthrapidly deoreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advanoing with hasty steps. His coriduct and appeorance had not chonged; he seomed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objeets about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, andhis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his asfistanoe with mare than usucll earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my exjſtence aſ liltle as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your friend's hanour.\"—\"How? lell me how? I would do any thirig,\" roplied Aubrey.—\"I need bul little—my life ebbs apace—I eannot explain thc whole—but if you would conceal all yau know os ine, rny honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were un kriown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shaIl not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exvltant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year anda day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any woy, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—Hif eyes se omed burstingfrom their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.\nA ubrey retired to rest, but did not slcep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintoriee with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered hls ooth a cold shivering came 0ver him, as if from the presentiment of something horrl6le awaiting him. Rising earIy in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which he hcld left the corpse, when a robbcr met him, and informed himthat it was no 1ongcr there, having been c0nveyed by himself orid comrades, upon hif retiring, lo the pinnaole of a neighbouring mount, aecording to a promife they hcld given his lordship, thal it should he exposed to the first cold ray of tho moon thatrose ofter his declth. Aubrey aftonished, and taking several of lhe men, determined to go and bvry it upon the spot where it Iay. But, wben be had mounted to lhe summit he sound no trace of either lhe corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they bad laid the b0dy. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that tbey had buried the corpſe for the sake of the cl0lhes.\nWeary of a courilry in which he had met with ſuch terrible mjsfortunes, and iri which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, he res olved l0 leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to canvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he oceupied himsels in arranging those effects he had with him belongjng to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapled to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning tbem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at fjnding a sheath apparently orriamented in tbo same style as the dogger diſcovered in the fatal hvt—he shuddcred—haſtening to gain furtber proof, he found tho weapon, and his borror may be imagjned when he discovered that it fitted, though pocuIiarly shaped, the sheatb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed ga2ing to be bound to lhe dagger; yct stilI he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon lhe haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for d oubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Ro me, his fjrst inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and sbe had nat been heard of since lbe departuro of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almostbroken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid lhat this lady had fallen a victiin to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted jn urging lhe speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which ſeemed abedierit to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and hc hostened to the mansiori of his fatbers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantinc caresses, had gainod his affection, now that the woman began to appear, sbe was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had riot that winnlng grclce wbich gains the gaze and appIause of tbe drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of thclt light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blve oye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm ab0ut it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, bvl from some feelirig within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was riot that light sooting, which strays whero'er a butterfly ora colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alorie, her face was never brightened by the smile of jay; but when her br0ther breat-\nhed to her his affect ion, and would in her presence forget lhase griefs she knew dostroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her fmile for that os the uoluptvary? It seemod as if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preseritation should 6e delayed untiI her brother's returri fromthe continent, when he might be hcr protector. It was now, therefore, resoIved thclt the next drawing-room, which was fastapproaching, should be the epoch of ber entry into the \"buſy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave reinained in the mansion os his fathers, and fed up0n the ineIancboly which overpowered him. He could not feel interesl about the frlvolities of fashionable strongers, when bis mind had been so torri by the events he had witnessod; but he determined to sacrifice hls own comfort to the protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared f0r the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nTbe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and al1 who were clnxious to bask in the s mile of royally, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While ho was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all araund him, cngaged in tho remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very plaoe—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his eor—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage t0 turn, fearfuI of seeing a spectre that would blast hjm, when he perceiued, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice ori this spot upon his first entry into so cicty. He gozed till hls limbſ almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and foreing a paſsage through the crowd, he threw himself irito his carriage, and wos driven home. Hc paced thc room with hurried steps, and fixcd his hands upon bis head, as jf he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances star-\nted up in dreadfvl array—the dagger—bis oath.—He roused himsels, he could nal believe it possible—the dead rise agoin!—He thought his imaginalion had conjured up the image hif mirid was rest-\nirig upon. It was impofsible that it couId be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attemptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurig vpon his lips, and he eauld not succecd in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection os a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave hiinself up ta his own devouring thovghts.Pcrceiving, at last, that many were leaving, ho roused himſelf, and entering another room, found his sister furrounded by several, apparently in earnest canversalion; he attemptod to pass and get near her, when one, wbom he requested to move, tvrned round,and reveoled lo him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sjster'sarm, and, with hurried step, forcod her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting f0r their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, be again heard that voico whisper eIose to him—\"Remember your oalh!\"—He did not darcto turn, but, hurrying his sister, soori reached home.\nAu6rey became cllmost distracted. If befare his mind had been abſorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engroſsed, now that the certainty of the inonster's 1iving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain thal she intrcated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt condu ct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, tbe more he was bewildered. His aath startled him;—was he thcn to allow this monster to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, ainidst all he held dear, and not avert its progrefs? His very sister mlght hclve been tauched by hlm. But euen if be were to break his oath, and disclose bif suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing bis own hand to free the world fram such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already inocked. For days ho remained in this state; shut up in his room,hc fow no one, and ate only when his ſister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stil1ness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from streot to stroet, anxious to fly that image whioh haunted hiin. His dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no langer to 6e recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him downto rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safoly, employed people to follow him; butthey were soon distonced by him who fled from a pursuer swister than any—from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily chariged. Struck with the idea thal ho left by his absence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence tbey were unconscious, he determined to cnter agoin into society, and watcb bim clasely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when heentered into a room, hls haggard and suspicious looks were so st riking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstclin from seeking, for her sake, cl society which offected hlm so strongly. When, however, remonſtrance proved vnavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whjch had boen bofore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dai ly encountered in hls wanderings, and of preventirig him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what tbey considered folly, they engaged aphysician to reside iri tbe house, and take conslant care of him. He hard1y appeared to notice it, so completely was bis mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherenee beeame at laft so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wovld often lie for days, incapable af being roused. He had become emaciated, his cyes had attained a glassy lustrc;—the only sign of afsecti0n and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tho enlry of hissister; then hc would sometirnes start, and, sejzing her hands,with looks thal severely afflicted her, he would dosire her not to touch hirn. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your loue for me is aught, do riot go rieor him!\" Wben, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he ſank jnto a state, wbence riot even she could rouse him. Thif lasted many months: gradually, however, as the yeclr was passing, his incoherenees became less frequent, and hiſ mind tbrew off a portion of its gloom, whilſt his guardians observed, thal severcll t imes in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite numher, and tben smile.\nThe lime had nearly elapscd, when, up0n the lclst day of the year, one of his guardians enterlng his raom, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avbrcy's being in so awfu1 a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. InstantlyAubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch tbey feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a young Earl whom he had met with in sociely, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis iritontiori to be presenl at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sist er. They answered not, but in a few minutes his fister was with him. He was apparcntly again capable of being asfected by the influence of her lovely smiIe; for he pressed her tohis breast, and kissed her cheek, wot with tears, fl0wing at the thought of her brolher's bejng once more alive to tbe feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmlh, and to congratvlate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank arid euery accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprjse at beholding the features of the monster who had so long inf1uenced his life. He seized tbe portrait ln a paroxysm of rage, and trampIed jt under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future busbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then ſeizing her hands, arid gazing on her with a srantic expression of countcriance, he badeher swear thatshc would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if tbat voice again bade hirn rememberhis oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard lhe whole, and thought this wcls but a return of his disorder, ent-\nered, and sorcing him from Miss Aub rey, desired hcr to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, be begged of them to deIay but for one day. They, attrjbvting thisto the insanjty they imagined had taken possession of hls mind, endeovaured to pocify him, and rctired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had beon refused with every one else. Wheri he heard of Aubrey'ſ ill hecllth, he readily understood himself ta be the cause os it; but wheri he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation andpleasure could hardly be concealed from those among wham he had gained this informatjon. Ho hastoned to the house 0f his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and the pretence os great offection for the brother and intorest in his fale, he graducl1ly wori the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resisl his power? Hiſ t0ngue had dangers and toils to recovnt—could speak of himse1f as of an individual having no sympathy with any being ori the crowded earth, save wlth her lo whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew ber, his exislonce, hadbegun to seern worthy of preservation, if it were merely tbat he might listen ta her soothirig aocents;—in fine, he knew so woll how to use the serpent's art, orsuch was the will of fate, tbat ho gained her affeotions. The title of the elder 6ranch falling at length to him, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hasteningthe marriage, (in spito of her brother's deranged state,) wbich waſ to take place the very day before hls departure for the contincnt.\nAubrey, when he was lefl by the physician and his guardians, atlempled lo bribo the servclnts, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; hewrote a letter to his sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own boriour, and the hon0ur of thoſe now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for o fow hovrs that rnarriage, on which hc den0unced the mosl heavy curses. The servonts promised they would deIiver it; bul giving lt to the physicion, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates os the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the nates os busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of corriages broke upon his ear. Aubrcy grew almost franlic. Thc curiosity of the servants at last overcame thejr vigilance, thoy graduolly slole away, leaving hirn in the custody of an helpless old womari. He seized the apportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a rnoment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takinghis arm hy force, hurried hlm from the ro0m, speechless with rage. When on the ftaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my 6ride ta day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So fclying, he pushed him towards his atlend ants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no loriger support hiinself; his ragenat firiding vent, had broken a blood-vesſel, and he was c0nveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, whowas not present when he eritered, as the physician waf afraid of agitatirig her. The marriage was solcmnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion 0f blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his ſisler's guardians might bo called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related c0mposedly what the reader haf perused—he died immediately after.\nThe gvardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wben they arrived, it was too 1 ate. Lord Ruthven had disclppeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thjrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tbe world was alI beforehim, where to chaose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greeian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 18I2, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certcliri supply of cattle and vegetables always to 6e had there, induce many British vessels lo visit it—both men of war and merchontmen; and tbough it lies rather out of lhe tra ck for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviotion of a voyage. We landed; as usua1, at the boltom of thc bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myse1f to0k a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticuIe so named) we mct witb and engclged a young Greek as ovr guide, who told us he hcld come from Scio with an English lord, wbo lest the islarid sour days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pjlot,\" said tbe Greek, \"andwould have taken me with him; but I did not choose to qvit Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was anodd, bvt a very good man. The cottage over the hil1, facing the river, belongs to hjm, and he has left an old mcln in cbclrge of it: ho gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has reslded there about fourteen months, though not constant1y; for he sa ils in his felucca very 0ften to the differont is1ands.\"\nThis account excitedour cvriosity very mueh, and we lost no time in hastening tothe house whore our countryrnan had resjded. We were kindly recejved by an old man, who conducted us ouer the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrclnce hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlovr, and a6ed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnarble tablcs on ejther side, a large myrtle ln the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which couId be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in tbe side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairf, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread an the floor, with two stuffed cotlon quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In tho sitling-ro0m we obscrved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which were then in a lclrge seaman's chest jn the closel: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts. Ori the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rausseau's works comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mllton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed at Parma in 1810; severa1 small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplc, much torn, hut no English book of any description. Most of those bookſ were filled with marginal notes,written wlth a pencil, in Italian ond Latin. The Messiah was lilerally scri6bled all over, and marked wilh slips of paper, on whioh alsa were remarkſ.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had bcen reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there thcy must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to rnove one thing without orders, he would frown upon rne for a week together; hcis oth erways very good. I oncedid him a service; and I have the produce of tbis farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechin es which I pay t0 an aged Arrnenian who rcsldes in cl small cottage in the wood, and whom lhe lord brought bero from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanee of the house externally waſ pleasjng. The portico ln frorit was fifly paces Iong and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars witb 6lack pljnths and fret-work cor nices, (as it is now customary jn Grecian architecture,) were confiderably bigher lhan the roos. The roof, surroundedby a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tvrkey earpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most os thc housc-tops are thuf furniſhed, af upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we enlered the house, a srnall streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on itſ borders, and under thc shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed mariy of his evenings ond nlghts till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" sclid the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devo-\nut, \"and always attended our churcb twice a week, besjdes Sundays.\"\nThe view fr0m this seat wcls what may 6etermed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye ta Mount CalcIa, coverod witb olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on lhe summit of which an ancient Greek ternple appeared in majestio decay. A fmall stream issuing from the ruins descended in brokencascades, untjl il wos losl iri the woads noarthe mouritain's base. The sea smooth as g1ass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, lhrough a vista oflofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands werc distinotly observed, ſtuddjng the light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I feldom enjoyed a vjew more tban I djd this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person wh0 had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wha had gone to Candia. \"Tbe Armeniari,\" said ovr c0nductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he wlll not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I con,\" sald he, \"I dare not.\" We had not tirne to vlsit the Armenian, 6ut on ovr return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. Ho hod portioned eight young girlswhen he was laſt vpon tbe lsland, and oven danced with them at the nuptial feasl. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, ond cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. Ho also bought a newboat for a fishermari who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave GreekTestamonts to tho paor children. In ſhort, he appeared to us, from all we coIlected, to have been a very ecoentric and benevoIent character. Ono circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at thc c otlage thought proper not to disolose. He had a most beautiful daugbter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and he hod bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch waſ the information with which we departed from the peaeeful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on tbe rack, guessjng who this rambler iri Greece cavld be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and alI those eccenlrioities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dovhtf were dispelled. FaIlingin compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt andGreece, \"The indivjdual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I mel him in my travols on the ifland of Tenedos, arid I alſo visited hirn at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordsbip's fame, as we bad been some years fram home; but \"Chi1de Harolde\" being put into our hondſ we recognized the recluse of Calcla in overy page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we corisolcd ourselvef with the idea of returning t0 Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never retum. I make thls statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordsbip's good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has been dcscribcd as of an unfeeling dlsposition, avcrse to associatjng with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its forrows, or add lo jts pIeasures. Tbe fact is directly tho reverse, oſ may be plalrily gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feolings of the heart, sa elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of ſolitude is an additional reason for marking hjm cls a being on whosc heart Reljgion bath set her seal, and over whosehead Benev0lence hath thrown her inontle. No man can rcad the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a eountryman. With respect to his loves or pleasuros, I do not assume a right to give an oplnion. Reports are ever tobe received with caut-\nion, pclrticularly wheri directed against man'ſ moral integrity; arid be wbo dares juslify bimself beforc that awful tribunal where all must appear, cllone may censure the errors os a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good insecret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony 0f a virtuous heart andself-approving conscierice.\nTHE END\nGiIlet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori\nTHE svperstition upon which lhis tale is founded ls uery general in the East. Among the Arahians it appears to be eommon: it did not, hawever, extend itsels to the Greoks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greckchurches; at which timc, the idea becoming prevalent, thal a Lalin body could nol eorrupt if bvried in their tcrrjtory, it gradually iricreased, and formed the subject of mony wondorful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their gravos, and feeding upon the blood of the young and bcautiful. In the Wesl it sprecld, wilh some slight variation, aIl over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the bolief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion af the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strenglh, and speedily died of consumptions; whilſt these hum an blood-suckers fattened—and theirveins bcoame distended lo such o state of repletion, cls to cauſe the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn tbe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hurigary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commclnder-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they pofitive1y and urianiinously afsjrmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassavia, on lhe frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of thc euil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing hirnself with his blood. This pr ecaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vompyre himself; for, a6out twenty or thirty days after his deoth and burial, many persons complained of having been t0rmented by him, and a depositlon was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitarits having confulted their Hadagni, took up tbe body, and found il (as is supposed lo be usual in ca ses of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptian, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proaf having been thus obtained, lhey res0rted to the accustomed rernedy. A stake wcls driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have oried ovt as dreadfully as if he had been aljve. Thiſ dono, thoy cut off his head, burned his body, arid threw lhe aſhes into his grave. Thc samc moclsures were adopted wlth the corses of lhase persans who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belicf is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vompyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief balliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontode is here related, because it seems better adapted to j1lustrate the sub ject os the present ohservations than any olher instance which could be adduced. In many partsof Greece it is consi dered as a sort af punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased iſ not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal uisitatjons solely to those beings he loved inost while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on eorth, asVampyre serit, Thy corse shall from its lomb be rent; Then ghastly h aunt the natiue pIace, And suck thc blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wifo, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yetloathe the banquet which perforcc Must feed thy livid living corsc, Thy victims, ore they yet expire, ShalI know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on tbe stem. Bul one thal for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, ShaIl bless thee with a father's name— That word sholl wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's 1ast tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glanoe must view Which free2es a'er its lifeless blue; Thon with unhallowed harid sha1l tear The lresses of her yellow hair, Os which, in lifc a lock when shorn Affectjon's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, ond hagg-\nard lip; Then ftalklng to thy fullen gravo, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in harror shrink away From spectre more accursed than tbey.\nMr. Southey bos also introduced in his wi1d but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Orieiza, whois represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of torinenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted srom the sinfulness of her life, she being povrtrayed throughout the whole of the lale os a complete type of purity and innoeence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of severaI astonishing cases af vampyrifm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmot, in hif great work vpon this subject, befides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narr atives illustrative of its effects, bas put forth s0me loarned dissertalians, teriding to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and lnteresting notices on lhis singvlarly horrib1e superstiti0n migbt be added; lhough the present may suffice f0r the limits of a no te, necessarily devoted to explanation, clnd which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several otbers synonymous with it, made use of in various parts ofthe world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations otlendant upori a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the lcaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than hls rank. He gazed upon the mirlh around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, lhe light laughter of the sair onlyattracted his atlention, that he might by a l0okqvell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt thif sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing vpon the obiect'ssace, did not seom to penetrate, and at ane glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaderi ray thclt weighcd upon the skin it oould not pass. His peeuliarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been aceustomed to violenl excitement, and now fe1t the weight of ennui, were pleosed at having somcthing in their presence capa6le of engaging their attention. In spite of the doadly hue oshis faco, which never gained a warmer tint, either from lhe blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters af ter notoriety attemptod to win his attenlions, and gain, at least, same inarks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sbewn in drawing-r0oms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put ori lbe dress af a mountebank, to attracl his notice:—tbough jn vain:—when she stood hefore him, tbough his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was basfled, and she left thefield. But though the common adultress could not irifluence even the guidclnce of his eyes, it was n0t that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet such was the apparent cautian with whieh he spoke to thc virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew hc ever addressed himself to females. He had, bowcver, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whetber it was that it euon ouercame the dread of his singular charocter, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was as often among thofe females who formthe boast of lhoirsex from their domestic virtues, as arnong thase who sully it by their vices.\nAb0ut the same time, there came ta Londan a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the poſsession of great weoltb, by parents who died while ho was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his f0rtune, while thoy relinquished tbe rnore imporlant charge of his mind to the care of merconary subalterns, he cultivated more his iinaginatian tban his judgment. He had, bence, thal high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, which daily ruiris so many milliners' apprentioes. He believed all to sympclthise wjth virtue, and thought that vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for the piclurosque effecl of the scene, as we see in romances: he lhought thot the misery of a cottage inerely consifted in the vesting os clotbes, whicb were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variouf coloured patches. He tbought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Hewas handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon hif entering inlo the gay circles, mclny motbers surrounded him, striving which should deseribo with least truth their languishirig or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their br ightening countenances wheri he a pproached,and by their sparkling eyes, wheri he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ro monce of bis solitary hours, he was startled at findirig, that, except inthe tall0w and wax candles that slickered, not from tho presence of a ghost, but from want of sriufflng, there was no foundatian in real 1jfe for any of tbat congeries of pleasing piclures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from whlch ho had formed his sludy. Finding, however, some compensation in his grotifjed vanity, he waf about to reliriquifh his dreams, wheri the extraordlnary being we have above described, crossed him jn his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility af f0rming an idea0f the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gaue fow 0ther signs of his obfervation of oxternal objccts, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginatjon to plcture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed thls objoct irito the hero of cl romanco, and determined to observe the offsprjrig 0f hjs fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advclriced upon his notice, that his preſonoe was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven'ſ affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street,lhat he was a6out to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, ti1l now, had on1y whetled his curiofity, he hinled t0 his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thovght necessary lo enoble the y0ung to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an eqvality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fa1len from the skies, whenever ſoandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects af pleasantry or of praise, accordirig t0 the degree os skill shewri in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his interitioris to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive frorn him a proposol to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, appareritly, had nothlng iri common with other men, he gladly accepted il, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHithorto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found, that, though many inore of his clctions were exposed to his view, the results offer ed different conclusians from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagobond, arid the beggar, received fromhis hand more lhan enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey covld not avold remarking, that it was not vp0n the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misforlunes attendant even upon virtve, that he bestowed his olms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligclte came to ask somelhirig, not to relieve his warits, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, howeuer, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, wblch generally preuai1s over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigcnt. There was one circvmstance about tbe charity of his Lordship, which was stillmore impressedupon his mind: clll those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there waf a curse upon it, for tbey were all either led to lhescaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the m0st abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which thoy passed, Aubr ey was svrprizod at lhe apparent eagerness with which hls companion sought for the centres of all fashioriabIe vice; thero he entered into aIl the spirit af the fara table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he losl even more than he gained; but it waſ always wjth the some unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash yovthful n0vice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortu ne's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than thcll of the cat whilst dallying with the haIf-dead mouse. In cvery town, he left the formerly affluerit youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fale that had drawn him within thc reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, omidst the spoaking looks of mule hungry children, wlthout a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewith to buy evcn sufficient to satisfy their present crauing. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately l0st, to tho ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innoccnt: this might but be the result of o ccrtain degree of knowledge,which was not, however, copoble of combating the cunriirig of the more exporienced. Aubrey often wished to represcnt this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleclsure which praved the ruin of alI, and did not tend to bisown profit;—but he dolayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speakjng fronkly and openly to him; however, this never oecvrred. Lord Ruthvenin his carriage, ond amidst the vari-\nous wild andrich scencs of nature, was always the same: his eye fpoke less than his lip; and tbaugh Aubrey waf near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greclter gratification from it than the conftarit excitemcnt os vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hjs exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of somelhing supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; be left hjm in daily ottendonce upon the mornlng circle of an Italjan countess, whilsl he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arriued fromEngland, which he opened wilh eagor impatience; the first was from his sisler, breathing nothing but clffection; the others were frorn his guardians, the latter astonished hjm; jf it had beforc enterod into his imaginatiori that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for tho helief. His guardians insjsted upon his lmmediatoly leaving his friend, and urged, tbat his character waf droadfully uicious, for that the possession of irresisti6le po wers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerovs to society. It had been discovered, that his conternpt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had required, ta enhance his gratification, that his viclim, the partnor of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to tbe lowest abyss af infclmy and degradation: in fine, that all those fo males whom he hod sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mosk aside, ond had not scruplod lo expose the who1e deformity of their vices to the public goze.\nAubrey determined upon leclving one, whose cbarocter had not yet shown a single brjght point ori which ta rest the eye. He resoIved to invent some plavsib1e pretext for abandoning him altogetber, purposing, in lhe mean while, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight circumstances pclss by unnoticed. He entered irito the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordshlp was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of thc lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom thclt an unmarried female is met with iri soclety; he was thereforo obliged to car ry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye sollowed him in all his wlndings, and soondiscovored that an assignalion had been appointed, which would most likely ond in the ruin of an innooent, lhough thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he enterod the apclrtment of Lord Ruthven,and abruptly asked him his intentians with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his 6elng about to meet hcr tbat very night. Lard Ruthveri anfwered, thclt his intentioris were such as he supposed all would have upon such an accasiori; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely lavghed. Aubrey retired; clnd, immediately writing a note, to say, tbat from that moment he must dcclirie accompanying his Lordfhip in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her os all be knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also ooneerning the character of his Lordship. The assig nation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servont to notify his complete asserit to a soparation; but did not hint any suspiclon of his plans havlng beon foiled by Aubrey's iriterpositlon.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed bis steps t0wards Greece, and crossing the Periinsula, soon found himself at Atbens. He then fixed hjs residence in the house os a Greek; and ſoon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of clncient glory upori monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronieling the deeds of freemen anly before slaues, bad hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil 0r rnany coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himfelf, existed a being, so beautisul and delicato, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on cariva ss lhe promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's parodise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think fhe could belong to those who bad n0 foulſ. As she danced uponlhe p1 ain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would bave thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animaled nature, for thal sleepy luxvrious look of the animcll suited but to the taste of an epicvre. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the vneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere butterfly, show the who1c beauty of her form, floclting as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot lhe letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tress es falling, as sbe flitted arourid, exhibit in the sun's ray svch delicately brilliant and swift1y fading hves, jt might well excuse lhe forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind thevery object be hod before thought of vita1 importclnco to the proper interpretation os a passclge inPausanias. But why clt tempt to descrlbe charms whieh all feel, but none cari appreciate?—It was jnnocence, youth, and 6eauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew thoseremains of which he wished ta preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and walch the magic effectf of bis pencil, in tracing the scencs os her native p1ace; shc would then describe to him the circling donceupon the open plain, would palnt, to him in all the glowing c0lours of youtbful memory, the marriage pomp she rememhered viewing iri her infancy; and theri, turning to subjects tbat had evidenlly made a greater impression uponber mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nvrse. Her earnestness and apparerit belief of what ſhe narrated, excited the interesteven of Aubrey; and often asshe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidsl his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of alovely female to prolang his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run oold, wbilst he attempted to lavgh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited lo him the nclmes of old men, who had at last detected one liuing among themseIves, after several of their near relatives and children had heen found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite;and when she found him so increduI0us, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, thal those who bad dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged tbem, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She dotailed to him the traditional appearance of thcse monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate desoription of Lord Rulhuen; he, however, still persjsted in persuading her, that there cou1d be rio truth in her fears, thovgh at the same time he wondercd at lhe many coincidences which had all tended to excjto a belief in thesupernatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAuhrey began to attach himfelf more and mare to Ianthe; herinnocence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtuef of the women among wbom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; andwhile he ridieuled the idea of a young inan of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming aplan forsome antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to retvrn until his object was attained; but he always found it iinpossible to fix bif attention upon tbe ruins aroundhim, whilst in his mind he reta iried an irnage that seemed alone the righlful possessor of hls thaughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frclnk infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part fr0m bim wilh reluotance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilsl ber guardian wcls occupied in sketohing or uricovering some fragment wbich had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed lo her parents on the subjeet 0f Vampyres, and they both, with several present, afsirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very namo. Soon after, Aubreydetermjned to proceed upon one of his exeursions, whjcb was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard tbo narne of the place, they all at onee begged af him not to return at night, as he musl necessari1y pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the dcly had closed, upon any consideratiori. They described it as thc resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon hlm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made llght of their representations, and triedto Iaugh them out of the idea; but when he saw thcm shudder at bis daring thus to mock a superior, inf ernal powcr, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Avbrey set off upon his excursion unattcnded; he was surprised to observe the melanchaly face of his host, and was eoncemed to find thclt hls words, mocking the belies of those horrible fiends, hod jnspired tbem with fuch terror. When he was aboul to depart, Ianthe came t0 tbe side of his horse, and earneslly begged of him to return, cre night allowed the power of these beingf to 6e put in action;—he promised. He was, however, fo occupied in his research, that he did nol perceive that day-light would soori end,and thal ln the harlzon there was one of thase specks whieh, iri thc warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage vpon the deuoted country.—He at lclst, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed sor his delay: but it was too late. TwiIight, in these sovthern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the powcr of lhe slorm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced itswcly through the canopying fo1iage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and rcldiate at hiſ very feet. Suddenly his horse took frigbt, and he was carricd with dreadful rapidity through the entclngled forest. The ariimal at last, lhrough satlgue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of Iightning, that he was in the neigh6ourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itse1f up from the masses of dead lcaves and 6rushwood w hich surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping lo find some one to guide him lo the t0wn,or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, al1owed him to hear the dreadful shriekf of a womon mingling with thestifled, exultclrit mockery of a laugh, continued in ono almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused hy lhe thunder which agairi r0lled over his head, he, with a sudden esfort, foroed open the daor of lhe hut.He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, thovgh he called, still the sounds continued,and no notice was taken of hiin. He found himself in conlact wilh some one, whom he immediately seized; when a vojce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by ono whose strenglh seemed fuperhuman: detcrmined lo sell his life as dearly cls he cauld, he slruggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet ond hurled with onormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upori his breast, had placed his hands vpon his throat—when the glare af many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in tho day, disturbed him;—he instaritly rofe, and, leaving his prey, rushed througb lhe door, and in a moment the crashing of lhe brancheſ, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapablo of moving, was soon heard by th0so without. They entered; tbe light of their torches foll upon the mud walls, arid the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. Al the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted hjm by her cries; he was again left in darknesf; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought ina lifeless corse. He shut his cyes, hoplng that it waf but a vlsion arifing from his disturbed imagiriatjon; but be again saw the same form, when be unolosed tbem, stretched byhis fide. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacblng as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was bIood, and upon ber throat were the marks of toeth having opened the vein:—lo this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, arid Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been tohim the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fclllen with lho flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thaughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge iri vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger os a particular construction, which had heen sound in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engoged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached tho city, farewarned the parents 0f some dreadfu1 catastrophe. —To desori6e their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained lhe cause of their child's death, they looked al Aubrey, and pointod to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAvbrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most uiolent fever, and waſ often delirious; in these intervals he would caIl upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unclccountable combinati0n he seemed ta heg of his foriner companion to sparo the bcing he loved. Al other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ohanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Avbroy, immediately placed himself in the same houso, and bocame his c0nstarit attenda nt. When the lattcr recoverod from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight 0f hlm whose imclge he had now combined wilh that of a Vompyre; 6ul Lord Ruthven, by bis kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault thal bod caused thelr separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and carc which he showed, soon reconolled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appcared that apathetic belng who had so aftonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvalescence began to he rapid, he again gradually retired jnto the same state 0f mind, and Aubrey percejved no difference from the former man, except that at tjmes he was surpriſed to meel his gaze fixed intently upon him, witb a smile of malicjous oxultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During tbe last stage of the invalid's recovery, LordRuthven was apparently engaged in watching tbe tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marklng the progress of those orbs, circ1ing, like our world, the inoveless suri;—irideed, hc appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distjnguished him riow secmed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of ſoljtude and silence cls Lord Ruthven; but mucb as hc wished for solitude, his mind c0uld nat find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had farinerly frequonted, Ianthe's form ftood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step wovld appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then svddenly turning round, would show, to hls wild imaginalion, her pale face ond wounded throat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. Hc determined to fly ſcenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he beld himself bound by the tender care he had taken ofhim during his illnesſ, that they should visit those parts of Greeee neither had yot seen. They travelled in every direction, and saught every spot to wbicha recollcction could be attached: but thovgh they thus hastened from plaoe lo place,yet they soemed not t0 heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to ſlight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuaIs, whose intereft it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended srom pretended dangers. In corisequence of thus neglecting the advice of the jnh-\nabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guidef than as a dofence. Upon entering, howeuer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whicb was the bcd of a torrent, with large inasses of rock brought down from the neighbouririg preeipjces, they had reason to repent their negl igence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engagcd in the narrow pa ss, whon they were startled by tbe whistling of bullels close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In cln instant their guards had 1eft them, and, placingthemselves behind rocks, had begun to flre iri the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retjred far a moment behind the shelteririg turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained 6y a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exp0sed to unrcsiſtlng slaughter, if any of thc robbers should climb abovc and take them in therear, they deterrnined at once to rusb forward ln seorch of the enemy. Hardly had they 1ost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his ossistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was saon surprised by seeing the robbers' faees around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately lbrown up their arms ond surrendered.\nBy promises of great roward, Avbrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring oabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content morely to guard the entrance till their comrade shauld return with the promiscd sum, for whlch be had an order. Lord Ruthven's ftrength rapid1y decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death ſeemed advancing with hasty stops. His coriduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objectsabout him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mlnd became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance wjth more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! y0umay save me—you may do more than tbat—I mean not my lise, I heed the dcath of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may ſave my honour, your fricnd's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but litlle—rny lifo ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conccal all you kriow of me, my honour were free from stain in thc world's mouth—arid if rny death were unknown for some tiine in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall nol be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying rnan, raising himself with cxulta nt violerico, \"Swear by all your soul reveros, by clll your nature foars, swear that, sor a yeclr and a day you wiIl n0t impart y0ur knowledgo of my crimes or deatb to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, ar whatever you may see. \"—His eyos seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circurnstances attending his aoquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when hc remembered his oath a cold shiveririg came ovcr him, as jf from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rifing early in thc morriing, be was about to enter the hovel in which he bad left lhe corpse,when a robber mcl him, and informed him that it was no loriger there, baving been conveyed by himseIf and oomrades, upon his retiring, lo the pirinacle of a neighbourjng mounl, accordjng to a promise they had g iven his lordship,thal it should be exposed to the first cold ray of tbe moon that rose afler his death. Aubrey astanished, and tclking several of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot whore it lay. But, when he had maunted to thc ſummit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothos, thougb the robbers sworc they pointed out the identical rock on whlch they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewjldered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that thoy had buried the c orpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had se ized vpon bis mind, he resolued to leave jt, arid soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Noples, he occu pied himsels in arranging those esfects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Amongst other things there was cl case c0ntaining severaI weapons of offerice, more or lefs adapted to ensure tho death of the victim. There were sevcral daggors and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and cxaminirig thejr curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented jn tbe samc flyle as lhe dagger discovered ln thefatoI hut—he shuddered—hastening t0 gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that jl fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no further eertainty—they seemed gazirig to be bound to the daggor; yet still he wished to disbelicve; but tbe particular form, the some uorying tints upan the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and lefl no room for douht; there were also drops of blood on oach.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthueri's seduclive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune rulned, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind becamc almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilioris, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived al Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wasted bim to the English shorcſ; and he hastened to the mansion of his fclthers, and there, for a momont, appeared to lose, in the embraceſ and caresses of his sister, all mcmory of the past. If she bes0re, by her infantine caresses, had gairied hjs affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winnirig grace which gains lhe gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was n0ne of that lighl brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity os the mind beneath. There was a meloncholy chclrm about it whicb did not seem to arise srom misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicalo a ſoul conscious of abrighler realm. Her step was not that light footing, whlch strays where'er a butterfly or a colovr may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alono, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew deſtroyed hjs resl, who would have exchanged ber smile for that of the volupluary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face wore then playing in the light of lheir own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, arid had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's returnfrom the continent, wheri he might be her prolectar. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy sccne.\" Aubrey would rather have remained iri the mansion of his fclthers, and fed upon thc melancholy which overpowered him. He oould not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionahle slrangerf, when bis mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he detormined to sacriflce his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. They soori arrlved in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced af a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was oxcessive—a drawing-room bad nol been held for a lang time, and all wha were anxiovs to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was tbere with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of a11 around him, engaged in the remembrance tbat the first time he had feen Lord Ruthveri was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a vo ico he recognized too well, soun-\nded in his ear—\"Remember yovr oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearfulof seejng a spectre tbot would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the samc figure which had attrocted his n0tice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazod till bis limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of clfriend, and sorcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himseIf into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thaughtswere bursting from his brairi. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started up in dreadsul array—the dagger— hif ooth.—He roused himfelf, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the jmage his rnind was resting upon. It was impossible that it cov1d be real—he dotermjned, thereforc, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask cancerning Lord Ruthveri, the name hung upon hif lips, and he cauld not succeed in galning information. He went a few nights after with his sistor to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired irito a recess, and lhere gave himself up lo hiſ own devouring thovghts. Perceivlng, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entcring anolher room, fourid his sister surrounded by several, apparentIy in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requosted to move, turned round, ond reveaIed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprangforward, seized his fister's arm, and,with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himsolf impeded by tbo crowd of servants who were waiting for theirlords; and while he waf engaged jn passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey becaine almost distracted. Is beforc hjs mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrofsed, now that lhe certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister'f atterilions were now vnheeded, and lt was in vain that shc intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupl conduct. He 0nIy uttered a few words, and those terrifiod her. The more hc thought, the more he was bewildered. His oclth start1ed hi m;—was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, am idst alI he held dear, and riat avert its progress? His very sister mjght bclve been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclase his suspicions, who would believe him? He thoughl of employing his ownhand to free the world from such a wrctch; bul death, he remembered, bad been already moeked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when his ſisler eame, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer copable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image whicb haunted him. His dresſ became neglected, and hc wandered, as osten cxposod to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to he recognized; at first he returned wilh the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue ouerlook him. His sister, anxiouſ for his safety, employed people lo fo1low him; but they were soori distanced by him who fled froin a pursuer swifter than clny—frorn lhought. His conduct, however, suddonly changed. Struek witb the idea that he left by hisabsence tbe whole of his friends, witb a fiend amongſt them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hif oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and sufpjcious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, tbat his sister was at last obljged to beg of him to abstain from soeking, for her sake, a fociety which affected him so strongly. Wh en, hawever, remonstranoe proved unavoiling, the guardians thought proper to intorpose, and, fearing that his mind was bccoming alienated, they thaught it high time to resume agajn that trvst which hod been before imposed upan thcm by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving him frorn the injuries ond sufferings he had daily encountered in his wandcrings, and of preventing him from exposing to lhe general eyc those rnarks of what they considered folly, they engaged a phyfician to residc in tbe hovse, and take canſtant care of him. He hardly appearcd to notice it, so complelely was his mind absor6ed by one terrible fubiect. His incoherence became at last so greot, that he was confined to his choinber. There he would often lie for days, incclpablc of being roused. He had become emaoiated, his eyes had attained a gIassy lustre;—the only sign 0f affection and recallection remairiing displayed ilseIf upon lhe entry of bis sister; then he would sometimes ftart, and, seizing her hondſ, with looks tbat severely afflicted her, be would desire her riot to t0uch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love sor me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his onIy answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank inlo a slate, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year wcls passing, his incoheren ces became less frequont, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observcd, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a dofinitc number, and then smile.\nThe time had rioarly elapsed, wben, upon the last day of the year, ono af his guardians entering his r0om, hegan to converse wilh his physiciari upon tbe melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri hjs sister was going next dcly to be married. Instontly Aubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this rnark of rcturning intellect, of which tbey fe ared he had been deprived, they mentionod the name af the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey secmed pleased, arid astonished them stil1 more by his expressing his interition to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sistor. They answered not, but jn a sew rninuteſ his sister waſ with him. He was apparently again capablo of beirig affected by the influonce 0f her lovely sinile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her hrother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He begcln to speak withall hiſ wonted warmth, and to corigratulale her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceiued a locket upon bcr breast; openirig ll, what wos hif surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his ljfe. He seized the portrait iri a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he Iaoked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing 0n her with a frclntic expression os countenarice, he bade her swear that she would neuer wed this monster, for he— But he could n0t aduance—it seemed as if thal voiceagain bade hjm remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In lho meantime the guardians and physician, who had heord tbo whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Misf Aubrey, desired ber to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, ho begged of them to delay but for one day. They, altributirig this to the insonity they imagined had taken possesſi0n of his mind, endcavourod to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had callcd the morning after the drawing-room, and had heen refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill heallh, he readily vnderstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from t hose among wbom he had gained this inforrnotion. He hastened to tho bouse of hjs former companion, ond, by constant attendarice, and the pretonoe of great clffection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gra-\ndually won the ear of Miss Aubrcy. Who cou1d resist his power?His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of bimself as of an individual having no fympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to wh0m he clddresfed hjmself;—could tell how, since he knew her, hisexistence, had bcgun to seem worthyof preservatjon, if it were merely that he might liſten to her soothing clccents;—in fino, he knew so well how lo use lhe serpent's art, 0r such was the will of fate, that he gained her affeclions. The title of the elderbranch falling at length lo him, he obtained an important embassy, whicb served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (ln spite of her brother's deranged slato,) which wasto take place lhe very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and hjs guardians, attemp ted to bribe the servonts, but in vain. He asked f0r pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuririg her, as sbe ualued her own happiness, hor own horiour, and the honovr of those nowin the grave, who once held her in their arms as thejr hope and the hope of their housc, to delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which he denounced the m0st heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physjcian, he thought it better not to haross any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without resl to the busy inmatesof the house; andAubrey heord, with a horror that may more easily be conceivedthari described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound os carriages broke upon his ear. Aubroy grew almast frantjc. The curiosity of tho scrvants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slole aw ay, leavinghim in the custody of an helplesſ old woman. He seized lhe opportvnity, with one hovnd was out 0f tbe room, and in a moment found bimself in the apclrtrnent where all werc riearly asscmbled. Lord Ruthven was the first t0 perceive him: he immediately approac hed, and, taking his arm by f0rce, hurried him froin the room, speechless with rage. When 0n the stairoase, Lord Ruthveri whifpered in his ear—\"Remembcr your oath, and kn ow, if not my bride to day, yaur sisler is dishonovred. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards hls attendants, who, roused hy the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer fupport himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessol, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned t0 his siſler, who wcls not present whcn he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitatirig her. The marrlage was solernnized, arid lhe bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAubrcy's weakness iricreased; the efsusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of dcath.He desjred his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the tbirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to ch0ose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing throu gh the Grccian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the har6our 0f Mitylene, in the island of lhat name. The beauty of this plaoe, and the certain supp1y of cattle and vogetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit il—both men of war and merchantmen; and lhough it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for tbe deviati0n of a uoyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were emp1oyed in watering, and the purser bargalning for cattle with the nativcs, the clergyman and myself took aramble to the cave called Homer's School, clnd olher plaees, where we had been besore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticu1e so named) we met with and engclged a young Greek as our guide, who t0ld us he had come from Scio wjth an English lord, who left tbe is1and four days previouſ to our arrival jn his felucca. \"He erigaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wouldbave taken me with him; but I did not chooso to qult Mltylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but avery good man. The cottage over the hill, sacing the river, 6elongs to bim, and he has 1est an old man iri charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred 2echines for it, (about L25O English curroncy,) and has resided t here about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islandſ.\"\nTbis account excited our euriosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryrnan had resided. Wc were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us overthe mansion. It cansisted of four apartinents on lhe ground-floor—ari ent rarice hall, a drclwing-r0om, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed.They were all sirnply decorated: plain green-slained wa1ls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in tbe centre, and a small fountoin berieath, which could bemade to play tbrough the 6ranches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning poſlure; a largo couch or sofa compleled the furniture. In the haIl stood holf a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-ease: there were rio mirrors, rior a slrigle pointing. The bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quiltſ and a pil1ow—the common bed throughout Greece. Iri the sitting-room we observed a mclrble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were theri in a largc seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokspeare's, B0ileau's, and Rousseau's works eomplete; Volney's Ruins of Empireſ; Zimmerman, in the Germ ari langvage; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebve's novels; Schiller's playof the Robbers; Miltan's Paradise Lost, ari Italian odition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greok press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were f illed with marginal notes, writtcn with a pencil, in ItaIian arid Latin. Tbe Mesfiah was literally seri6bled all over, and marked with s1ips of paper, on which alſo were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the everiing before he scliIed, and forgot to ploce them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his relurn; for he is so particulclr, that were I to move one thlng without orders, he would frown upon me for a week logether; he is olherways very good. I once did him a service; and I havc the produce of thjs farm for lhe troubleof taking care of it, except twerity zechines which I pay to an clged Armenian who rosides in a small cottoge in the wood, and whom the lord hrought here froin Adrianople; I don't know sor whot reason.\"\nThe appearance 0f the house externaIly was plcasing. The portico in front waſ fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pllnths and fret-work eornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) wereconsiderobly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a lighl stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awriing of strorig coarse linen.Most of the house-topſ are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pclss their evenings in smoking, drinking light winos, such os \"lochryma christi,\" eating frujt, and enjoying tho evening breeze.\nOn the left hclnd as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and lirnes were clustering togetber on its borders, ond undcr the sbade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooderi back was placed, ori which we wcre to ld, the lord passed mony of his evenings and nights till twelve a'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"prayirig\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended ovr church twice aweek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view fromthis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A 1ino os rich virieyards led the eye to Mount CaIcIa, covered with olive and myrtle treef in bloom, and on thesummit of whlcb an ancienl Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small strcam issuing from the ruins descended jn brokeri cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. Tbesea smooth as glass, and ari horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninateſ the view in front; and o little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-treef, several ſmall isIandſ wcro distinctly 0bserved, studding the light blue wave with spots of cmerald green. I seldom enjoyed a vlew m0re thcln Idid this; but our enquirjes were fruitless as to the name of the person who bcld resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his bankcr, who had gone to Cand-\nia.\"The Armenian,\" sald our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tcll, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" Webad not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the lown we lear nl several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was 1ast upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuplial feast. He gaue a cow t0 one man, horses to athers, and cotton and ſilk to the girls wbo live by weavlng these arliclef. Hc also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greok Testaments to the poor chil dren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collectcd, to have been avery eccentric and benevolent character. Onecircumstance we learnt, whjoh our old frierid at the cotlage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most boautiful daughter, with whom tbelord wos oftenseen walking an the sea-shore, and he hcld bought her o piano-farte, and taught her himself the usc of it.\nSucb was the information wilh which we departed fr0m the peaceful islc of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, gvessing who this ramb1er in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geniuſ. Arrived at Palermo, alI our dovbts wcre dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupi1 of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greecc, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxiaus, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\" We had ncver then heard of hjs lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe HaraIde\" being put into our hands wc recognized the recluse 0f Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having 6een more curious in our rosearcheſ at thc cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on s0me future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, beljeving it not qujte uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly sIandered. He has beon described as of ori unfeeling disposition,averſe to aſsociating with humcln nature, or contri6uting in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverfe, as may be plainly gathercd srom these little anecdates. All thc finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his l0rdship's poems, ſcem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderness, sympatby, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting tho repose of solitude is an additional reason for markirig him cls a bcing on whose heart Religion hath set her seol, and ovcr whose head Benevolerice hclth thrown her mantle. No inan can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him os a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I d0 not assume a right to give an opjnion. Reports are evcr to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integri ty; and he who dares justify hiinſelf beforo thal awfultribunal where all mvst appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron'scharacter is worthy af his genius. To do good in secrot, and shun the world's applause, is the surost testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prjnter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in lhe East. Among the Ar abians it appeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to lhe Greeks until ofter the establlfhrnent of Christianity; and it has only ossumed its presont form since the divisiori of the Latjn and Greek churohcs; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thot a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradua1ly increased, and formed the subjoct of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood 0f lhe young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with same sligbt variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and L0rraine, whcre the helief cxjstod, that vampyres nightly lmbibed o certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciatcd, loft their strength, arid speedily died of consuinptions; whjlst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their ueinſ became distended to such a stateof repletiori,as lo cause the blood to flow srom all the passages of their bodies, and even fram the very pores of tbeir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accourit of a particular case of vampyrjsm, which is stated to haue occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chlef and magistrates of lhe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, riarned Arnold Paul, had bcen heard to say, that,at Cass0via, on the frontiers of lhe Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid hlmself of the evil, by eating some os the earth out os the vampyre's grave, and rvbbing himself with his blood. This preoaution, however, did not p revent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, clboul twenty or thirty daysafter his death and bvrial, many persons complained of having been tormerited by him, and a deposilion was made, that four porsons had been deprived of life by hif attacks. To provent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposcd to be vsual in cases af vampyrism) frosh, and entirely free from corrvption, and emitting at the movth, n0se, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomcd remedy. A stake was driven entireIy through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is rep0rted to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they out osf his bead, 6urnod his body, and threw the ashesinto his grave. The same measures were adopted witb the corses of those persons wb0 bad proviously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in tbeir turn, become agents upon others who survived tbem.\nThe uriiversal helief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre beoomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate tbe subjoct of the presont obſervotions than any other inslance which covld be addvced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crimo committed whilst in existcncc, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie his inferna1 visitations solely to lhase beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whorn he was bound by tief of kindred and affectjon.—A supposition aIluded lo in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut flrſt on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from ils tomb be rent; Then ghostly haunl the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sjster, wife, At midnight draln the stream of lifo; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed tby livid livirig corse, Thy victims, ere tbey yol expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, tbou cursing them, Thy flowers are wjthered on the stem. Bvt onothal for thy crime mvst fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Sholl bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flaino! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's laslspark, And thelast glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhclllowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a look when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne awcly by thee Memorial os thine agony! Yet with thirie own best blood sbclll drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking lo thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in horror shrink away From spectre inore accurſed tban they.\nMr. Southcy hos also introduced in his wild but beautifulpoem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of tbo Arabian maid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned sram the grave for tbe purpose of tormenting bim she best loved wbilst in existencc. But thiſ cannot bo supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being paurtrayed throughovt the whole of the tale as a compIete type of purity arid innooence. The veracio us Tournefort gives a long account in bis travels of several astonishing eases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, and traditionary narratiues jllustrative of its esfects, has put fortb some learned dissertations, tending to prove it t0 be a classical, as well as borbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrihle superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, andwhich moy now be coricluded by merely remarking, that thougb the term Vampyre is the one in most generaI acceptation, there are severa1 others synonymous with it, made use of iri various parts of the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipationſ attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the Ieaders of the ton a nobleman, more remclrkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon lhe mirth around him, af if ho could riotparticipate thcrein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasls where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who selt this sensation of awc, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whjcb, fixing upon the objec t's face, did not seem to penetrale, ond at one gIarice to pierce thr0ugh ta the inward workings of the heart; but fell upan the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarjlies caused him to be invited to every housc; a1l wished to see him, and those wh0 had been accvslomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, wero pleaſed at having somothing in their preſence capclble of engclging their attcntion. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never galned a warmer tint, either from thc blush of modosty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline wore beautiful, many of the female bunters afler notorjety attempted to win his attontions, and gain, at least, some marks of whclt they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn jn drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did allbut put on the dress of a mountebank, ta attract his riotice:—though in vairi:—wheri she stood before him, though his eyes were apparontly fixed upan her's, still il seemed as if lhey were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence wasbaffled, and she left the fiold. But thovgh the common adultress could not influenceeven the guidance of his oyef, it was not that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet such was lhe apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, thal few knew he ever addressed hjmself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a win ning tongue; and whether it was tbat it even overcamo the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparont hatred of vice, he was as often among those femaleſ wh0 form the boast af their sex from their do mestic virtuos, asamong thosc who su1ly it by the ir vices.\nAbout the somo timo, there came to London a young gentlernan of the name of Avbrey: he was ori orphan 1eft with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alsolo himself by guardians, who thoughl it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquishod thc more important charge of bis mind to the cclre os mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imclgiriatlori than his iudgment. He had, hence, that hlgh romantic feeling of h0nour and candaur, which dai1y ruins so many milllriers' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque esfeet of the scene, af wo see in romances: he thought thal the inisery of a oottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, hut which were 6etter adclptod to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the drcams af poets were the realities of llfe. Ho was handsome, frank, ond rich: for these reasons, upon his enlering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded bim, slriving whlch should describe with least truth their lclriguishing or ramping favourltes: the davghters at the same ti me, 6y their brighteriing countenances when he approached, and by tbeir sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his ſolitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles tbat flickerod, nol from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snufsing, there was ria foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from wbich he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compenfation iri his gratified vanity, he was about to reIinquish his dreams, wheri tbe extraordinary being we have abaue deseribed, crossed bim in his career.\nHe watched him; and tho vory impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, who gave few 0ther sig nſ of his observation of external objects, thari lhe tacit assent t0 their exiſtence, imp1ied by the avoidance of their oontact: allowirig hjs imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soori formedthis objecl into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the perfon before him. He became acquainted wlth hlm, paid him attentions, and so far advanoed upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's asfairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from lhc notes of prcparation in — Street, that he was about to lrovel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this slngular cbaracter, who, till now, had only whetted bis curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations haf heen thought necessclry t0 enoble the young to take some rapid ſteps jn the caroer of vice towards putting themselvef upon an equallty with the aged, and not aIlowing them to appear as if folleri from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleafantry or of praise, occording to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. Thoy consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to jojn him. Flattered bysuch a mark of estecm from him, who, apparently, had notbing in common with otbcr men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed lhe circling waters.\nHilherto, Avbrey had had no opportunity of studying Lard Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions wereexposed to bis view, the results ossered different coriclusions from thc apparent motives lo his conduct. His compariion was profuse in his libercllity;—the idle, lhe vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hclnd morc than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avold remarking, that it was nat upon the vlrtuous, roduced to indigence by tbe misfortunes attendanl even up0n virtue, that ho bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardlysuppressed sneers; but when the profligale camo to afk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink hjm still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with ricb charity. This was, howevor, altributed by him to the greater imporlunity of thc vicious, which generally prevoils ovcr the retiring bashfulnesſ of the virtuous ind igenl. There waf one circumstance abovt the chari ty of his Lordship, whioh was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon wbom il was bestowed, inevitably found that there wasa curfe upon it, for they wereall either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and tbe moſt abject misery. At Brusfels arid other towns thr0ugh which lhey passed, Auhrey was surprjzed attho apparent oagerness with whjch his companion sought for the centres ofall fashionable vioe; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharpcr was his antagonist, and then he last even more than he gained; but it was always with the sclme unchanging face, with which he generally watchod the society around: it was not, however, fo when he encountered tbe rash youthful novioc, or the luckless father of a numer0us family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparerit abstractednefs af mind was laid clslde, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of tho cal whilst dallylng witb the balf-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude af a dungean, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of tbis fiend; whilst many a father sat fraritic, amidst the speakirig looks of mvte hungry children, without a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewjth to buy even suffloient t0 satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money srom lhe gambling tablc; but immcdiately lost, to the ruiner 0f many, the last gil der he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mig ht but be the result of a certain degree os knowIedge, which was nol, however, capable of combating the cunnirig os the more experjenced. Auhrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasure whioh proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity as speoking frankly and openly to him; however, this never ocourred. Lord Rutbven in hif carrioge, and amidst the varjous wild ond rich scenes of nature, was always the same: hiseye spoke loss than his lip; and though Aubrey was riear the object of bis curlosity, he obtained no greoter gratjfication from it than the constant excilement of vainly wishing to break that myſtery, whlch to his exalted imaginatiori b egan lo assvme the appearance of something supematvral.\nThey soon arriued at Rome, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendanee upon lhe morning circle of an Italian countoss, whilst he went in search of the inemorials of ariother almost deserted city. Whilst he was lhus engaged, letters orrived frorn England, which he opened with eager impatience; the fjrst was from his sister, breathing nothing hut affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter aslonished him; if it had besore entered into his lmagination that there was an evil power resident in his compani0n, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted up0n his immediately 1eaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possessian of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adullress had not originated in hatred of hor charact er; but tbat he had re quired, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of bis guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsulIied virtve, down to the lowest abyssos infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those femcl les wh0m he had sought, apparenlly on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and bad not scrupled to expose the whole defo rmity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose oharacter had not yet shown a single brig ht point on which to rest the eye. He resalued to invent some plausible pretext for a6andoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him mare closely, and to let no slight circumstanceſ pass by unnoticed. Heentered into the same circlo, and soon perceived, that his Lordship waf erideovouring to work upon the inexperience of the davghter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequerited. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmclrried female is met with in society; he was therofore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignatjon had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of on jnnocenl, though thougbtless girl. Losjng no time, he eritered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptlyasked him his intentions with respect to the lody, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his bejng about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answered, that hjs intentions were such aſ he svpp0sed all would haue upon suoh an occasion; and upan being pressed whetber he intended to marry her, m erely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immedialely writing a note, to say, that srom that moment be must decline accornpanying his Lordfhip in lhe remalnder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and callirig vpon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughlor, but also concerning the character of his Lordſhlp. The ofsignatian was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely senl his servanl to notify his camplete assent to a separation; but did nol hint any suspicion af his p1 anſ having beeri foiled by Aubrey's interpasitian.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stcps towards Greece, and crossing the Penirisula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence jn thc house of a Greek; and soon occupied biinself in tracing the faded rcc0rds of ancient glory upori monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chroniclirig the de eds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roos as himself, existed a beirig, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed thc model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hopo of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, savo thclt her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plairi, or tripped along tbe movntain's side, one would have thought thc gazelle a poor type of her bcauties; for who would have exchariged her oye, apparently the eye of onimated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the ariimal suited but lo the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncanſoious girl, engaged in the pursuit os a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind,to the eager gaze of him, wha forgot the letlers he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-1ike figure. Ofton would her tresses falling, as she flitted araund, exhibjt in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulnesf of the anliquary, wbo let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretatiori of a passage in Pausanias. Bvt why atleinpt to describe charms which al1 feel, but rione can appreciato?—It waſ innocence, youth, ond becluty, unaffccted by crowdeddrawing-rooins and stifling balls.Whilst hc drew those remains of which he wlshed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effeots of hjs penoil, in tracing the sccnes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circIjng dance upon the open plairi, wovld pairit, to him in all the glowing ealours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp ſhe rcmembered viewing in her lnfancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made cl greoler impression upon her mind, would tellhim all the supernatural tales os her nurse. Her earneftness and apparent 6elief of what she riarrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as sbe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upan the life of a love ly female to prolong his existenoe for the erisuing months, his blo od would run cold, whllst be attempted to laugh her out of such idle and borrible santasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old rnen, who had at last detected one living among lhemselves, after several of thoir ncar relatives and children bad been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hiin so ineredulous, she begged of him to believe her, far it had been, remarkod, that those who had daredto questlon their exifterice,always hcld somc pr0of given, which obliged them, witb grief and heartbreaking, to corifess it was true. She detaiIed to bim the traditiona1 appoarance of these monstcrs, and his horror waf increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; be, however, still persifted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same lime hc wondered at thc many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in lhe superriatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAubrey begcln to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted witb all the asfected virtues of the wornen am0ng whom he had sought for his vision0f romance, won bis heart; arid whiIe he ridicv1ed the idea of a young rnan of Eriglish habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost sairy form bef0re him. He wou ld tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to retu rn unlil his object was attained; but be always found it impossible to fix his atteriti0n upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retairied an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughls. Ianthe was unconscious of hjs love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemod to part from bim with reluctancc; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could vis it her favourite havnts,whilst her guardian was ocoupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which hod yct escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to herparents onthe subject of Vampyres, and they bolh, wlth seueral present, affirmed their existence, pa1e with horror at the very name. Soon a ster, Aubrey determiried to proceed upon one of his oxcursions, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they hcard the namc of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek w0uld ever re main, after the day had closed, upon any consideratlon. Thoy described it as tbe resort of lhe uompyres jri their nocturrial orgies, and dcnounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon him wh0 dclred to cross their palh. Aubrey made light of their representotions, and tried to laugh thcm out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set oss upon his excurfion unattended; he was surprised to observe tho melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to fjnd that his wards, mocklng tbe belief of those horrible fjends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about lo depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnesl1y beggod of him to returri, ere riight allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he promjsed. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that be did not perceive that doy-lighl would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one af those specks which, in the warmer climcltes, so rapid1y gather into a tremeridous mass, and pour all their rclge upon the dovoted country.—He ot last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by speed for his delay: but it waſ too late. Twilight, in these southern climateſ, is almost unknown; immedlcltely the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders bad scarcely an iriterval of rest—its tbick heavy rairi forced its way through the canopying foliage, whi1st the blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took frjght, ond he was carried with dreadful rapidity tbrough the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fat-\niguc, stoppod, and he found, 6y lbe glare of lightning, that he was in the neighhourhood of a hovel that hardly liftcd itself up from the mafses of dead leaues and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he opproached, hop ing to find ſome one to guidc him tothe town, or at least trusling to obtainshelter from the pclting 0f lhe ftorm. As he approclched, the thunders, for a mo ment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, c ontinued in 0ne almost unbroken sovnd;—he was startled: but, roused by tbe tbunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a fudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He fovnd himself iri utter darkness: the sourid, however, gujded him. He was apparently unpereeived; for, though he ealled, still the sourids continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himsolf in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and be feIt himself grappled by one wh0se strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his lise as dear1y as he could, be struggled; hut it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enorm0us force against the ground:—his enemy threw himsclf upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when lho glare of many torohes penetrating through tbe hole that gaue light jn the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leavlng his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the cra ſhing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. Tho storin was now slill; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard 6y those without. They entered; the light of their torches fe1l upon the mud walls, and the thatch laadod on evcry individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire os Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was ogain left in darkncss; bvt what was his horror, when the light of thc torches once in0re burst upon him, to percejve the airy f0rm of his fair conductrefs broughl in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it wos bvt a vjsion arising from hjs disturbed imaginalion; but ho agairi saw the same form, whcn he unclosed them, stretched by hiſ side. There was no colovr upon her cheek, not even upon ber lip; yet lhore was a stillness about her faco thal seemed almost as attaching as tho life that once dweIt there:—upon her rieck and breast was hlo0d, and upon her throatwere the rnarks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horrar, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A 1itter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the sideof her wbo had lately been to him the obj ect of so many bright and fairy vislons, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what bis thoughts w ere—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held olmost vnconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a pa rticular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been ongclged in the search of her whom a mother hadmissed. Their lamentable crics, as they approached thc city, forewarned theparents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossib le; but wheri they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corfe. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrcy being put to 6ed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in thefe intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by someunaccountable combination he ſeemed to beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he wauld imprec ate ma1edictions upori his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanocd at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motivc, vpon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hjmseIf in the same h0use, and became his constant atlendant. When the lattcr recovered from his deljrium, hc was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had riow combined with that 0f o Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance f0r tbe foult that bad caused their separati0n, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he sbowed, soon reconoiled him to bis presence. His lordship seemcd quite changed; he no longer clppeared thclt apathetic being who hod so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no differerice from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gclze fixed intently upan him, with a smile of malicious exullationplaying upon his lips: he knew not wby, but this smile haunted him. During the laft stage af lhe invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was appareritly ongaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling bree2e, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, tbe moveleſs sun;—indeed, he clppeared to wish to avoid thc eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was mvch weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whicb had once so distinguisbed him now seemed to have flod for ovor. He was now as much a lover of solitude and si1ence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, bis mind could nol find it in the neighb0urhood of Athens; jf he sought it amidst the ruins he bad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he soughl it in the woods, her light step w0uld appear wandering amidst thc underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly lurning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale fclce and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile uponher lips. He determjned to fly scenes, every feature of wbjch created suchbitler asfociations iri his mind. He proposod to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himsolf bound by the lerider care he had taken of him during his illness, that tbey should visit those parts ofGreeoe neither hod yet seen. They travelled in cvery direction, and fovght every spot t0 which a recollection could be attached: but tbough they thus hastened from place to place, yet they soemed not to heed whclt they gazed upon. They heard much of r0bbers, but they gradually began to sl ight thefe reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest jt was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus neglecting lhe advice of tho inbabitants, on one occasion they lravelled withonly a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a dosenco. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whioh was the bed of a torrent, with lclrge masses os rock brought down from the noighbo-\nuring preciplees, they bad reaſon to repenl their negligence; for scarcely wero the whole of the party engaged in the narr0w pass, when they were stortled by the whistling of bullets cIose to their heads, and by the eehoed report of several guns. In an instant thejr guards had left tbem, and, placing themselves hehind rocks, had begun to fire jn the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven ond Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turri of thc defile: bvt ashamed of being thus detalned by a foe, who wjth insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposedto unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb ab0ve and take them in tbe rear, they determined at onoe to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven reccived a ſhot in the shoulder, which 6rought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heedirig the c0ntest or his own peril, was s0on surprised by seeing tbe robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and svrrendered.\nBy promjses of great reward, Aubrey soon induced tbem toconvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring ca6in; and having agreed upon a ransom, hc was no more distvrbed by tbejr presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrclde should return with the promised sum, for which he had cln order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days morliflcati0n ensuod, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconseious of pain as he bad beeri of the objects about him: but towards the clase oftbe laft evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye ofton fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earneflness—\"Assist me! y0u may save me—you may do more thari that—I mean not my life, I heed thc death ofmy existerice as littIe as tbat of the passing day; but yav may save my hanour, your friend's hon0ur.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my lise ebbs apace—I cannot oxplain the whole—but if you would concool all yov know af me, my honour were free from ſlain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but lifo.\"—\"It shall not bo known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself wjth exultant vio-\nIcnce, \"Swear by all your saul reueres, by all your naturo fears, swear that, for a year and aday you will not impart your kn0wledge of my crimes or death to any living boing in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from lheir sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laugbing upon his pillow,and brcathod rio more.\nAubroy retired ta rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintancc with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivorlng came ovcr him, as if from the presontiment of something horrible awaiting bim. Rising early in tbe m0rning, hewas about to enter the hovel in which he had lest the corpse, when a robber methim, and infarmod him thal it was na langer there, having been conveyed by himsolf and cainrades, upon his retiring, to lhe pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his deoth. Aubrey astonished, and tclking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upan the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he f0und no trace of eithcr the corpse or the clothes, thougb the robb ers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they hadlaid the body. For a time his mind wasbewildered in conjectures, but he at last retvrned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the soke of the clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had met with ſuch terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparontly conspired to heightcn lhat superstitious melanch0ly thal had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst olher thi ngs there was a case coritaining several weclpons of offerice, more or less adaptedto ensure tbe death of the vlctim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning thcm over, arid examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the samo style aſ the dagger discovered in the falal hut—he shuddcred—hasteriing to gainfurther proof, be found lhe weapon, and hishorror may be imagined when be difcovered that it fitted, though peculiar1y shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed t0 need no fvrther certainly—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room sor doubt; thore wcre also drops of bl0od on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on hiſ way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seduclivc arts. Her parents werc iri distress,their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard 0f since the departure of his lordſhip. Aubroy's mind beoamo almost broken under so many repealed horrors; he was afraid that lhis lady bad fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhc. He became morofe and silent; and his only occupation c0nslsted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were golng to savo the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wi11, ſoon wafted hiin to the English shores; and be hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and thcre, for a moinent, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, a1l memory of tho past. If she before, by her infantine carosses, had gained his affectjon, now that the woman begon to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey had not tbat wln nlng grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There wcls noneof that light brillioncy which only existf in the healed atmospberc of a crowded aparlment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the leuity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which djd not seem to arise fram misfortune, but from some feeljng wilbin, that appeared to indicate a s0ul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays whero'er a butterflyor a co1ovr mcly atlract—it was sedateand pensive. Wben alone, her face was never brightened 6y the smile of j0y; bul when her brother breathed to her hls afsection, and wauld in her pre-\nsence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchangcd her smile for lhat of the voluptuary? It scemed as if those eyes,—lhat sace were then playing in the light of their own nativo sphere.She was yet only eighte-\nen, and had not been presented ta the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should bo delayed until her brother's retum from lhe continent, wben hc might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved thattbo next drawing-room, which was fast approoching, should be the epoch of her entry into lhe \"bvsy fcene.\" Aubrey would rather have remai ned in lhe manslon of bis fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not foel interest ab0ut the srivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so torn by the evenls he had witnesſed; but he determined to sacrificc his 0wn oomfort lo the proteetion af his sister. They soon clrrived in t0wn, and preparod for tho next day, which had been clnnounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and aIl who were anxi-\nouſ to bask inthe smile of royalty, hastencd tbither. Aubrey was there with his sistcr. Whi1e he was stonding in a oorner by himself, beedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly selzed by the arm, and a voice ho recognizcd too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to tum, feclrful of seeing a spectre that would 6last bim, when he peroeived, at a little distance,lhe same figure which had clttraeted his notice on this spot upon his first entry lnto saciety. He gazed till hiſ limbs alm0st refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take thearm of a friend, and forcing a pasſage through the crowd, be threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his handſ upori his head, as if he were af raid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthvon again before him—oircumstarices started up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imaginatian hod oonjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, thereforo, to go again int0 society; sor though ho attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he oould not succeed in gaining information. He went a sew nights after with his siſter to the asſembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired inlo a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devauring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and eritering ariother room, faund his sister surrounded by several, apparenlly in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he rcquested lo move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He fprang forword, soized his sistcr's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced her towards the s treet: at the door he found himself impoded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voiee whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reachcd home.\nAubrey became almast distracted. If 6efore his mind had been absorbed by one svbject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now lhat the certainty of the monster's livjng again pressed upon his thovghtf. His sistcr's attentions were now unheeded, and il waſ in vain that she intreatod him to explain to her what hod caused his abrupt conduct. He only vttered a few words, and thosc terrified her. The more he thought, the more be was bewildered. His oath stortled him;—waf he then to ollow this monstcr to roam, bearing rvin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions,who would 6elieve him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he reinembered, had been already m0cked. For dayſ he remairied in this ſtate; shvt up in hiſ room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister come, wbo, with eyef streaming with tears, besought him, f0r her sake, to support riature. At last, no longer oapahle of bearing stillnessand solitude, be lest his houfe, roamcd from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected,and he wa ndered, as often exposed t0 the noon-day sun as to the inidnight damps. He was no 1onger to be recogriized; at first hc returned with the evening to the house; but at laſl be laid him down to rest whereuer fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxjous for his safety, employed people t0 follow him; but tbey were saon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, h0wever, suddenly ehanged. Struck with tbe idea that he left by his absence the wholc of his frierids, with a fiend amongst them, of wh0se presence thoy were unconscious, he determined to enler again into society, and watch him closely, anxiaus to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Rutbven approached with intimacy. But when he entered int0 a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were s0 striking, hif iriward shudderings so visible, thathis sjster wos at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, for ber sake, cl society which affectcdhim so strongly. When, bowever, rem0nstrance proved uriavailing, lhe guardiansthought proper to interpose, and, feoring lhat his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high tirne to resume again that trust which had been before impofed upan lhem by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reſide in the housc, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by ono terrible subject. His incoherence became clt last so great, thot he was confined to his chamher. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had became emaciated, his eyes had attained a gIassy lvstre;—the only sjgn of affection and recollection remaining displayed itſelf upon tho entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, ond, seizing her hands, with l ooks that severcly afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh,do not touch bim—if your I0vc for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, howover, she inquired l0 whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and agaln be sank jnta a state, whence not even sbe could rouſe him. This lclsted many months: gradually, howevcr, as the year was passing, his incoherences became loss frequent, and hif mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that severa1 times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smilc.\nThe time had noarly elapsed, when, upon the last dayof the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began ta converse with his physiciari upon tbe melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's bcing in so awful cl siluation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instanlly Aubrey's attentlon was attracted; he asked anxiovsly to whom. Glad of this mark 0f reluming jritollect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking tbis wos a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleafed, and astonished thom still moreby his expressing his intenlion to be present at the nuptials, and dcsiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes hls sister was with him. Hc was apparently again capable os being affected by the irifluonce 0f her lovely fmile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the lhaught of ber brotber's being onco moro alive to the feeIings of affcctjon. He began to speak wilb all his w0nted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; operiing it, what was his surprise at beholding the features os the monstor who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait lna poroxysm af ragc, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her askirig him why he thus dostroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing hcr hands, arid gazing on her witb a frantic expression of countenance, be bade her ſwear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not cldvance—jt seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, lhinking Lord Ruthveri was near bim butsaw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard tbe whole, and thought this was but a roturn of his disorder, entered, and f0rcing him from Miss Au6rey, defired her to leave him. He fell upori his knees lo them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, clttributing this to the in sanity they imagined had taken possession os his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvcri had calIed the morning after the drawing-room, and had 6een refused with euery one else. When he hoard of Aubrey's ill hea1th, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned thot he was deemed irisane, his exultatjon and pleasure could bardly be concealed from those am0rig wh0m he had gained this information. He hclstened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attcndance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradualIywon lhe ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resiſt his powcr? Hjs tangue had dangers and toils t0 recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy wlth any being ori lhe crowded earth, save with her to whom headdressed himſelf;—could tell how, since he knew hcr, his existerice, had begun to seem worlhy of preservation, if it were mcrcly that he might listen to her foothing accents;—in sine, he knew fo well how to use theserpent's art, or such wcls the will of fate, that he gained her asfections. The title of tho elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important einbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in splte of her brother's deranged state,) which waſ lo take p1ace the very day hefore his doparture for lhe continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physieian and his guardians, attempted t0 bribe the servants, 6ut in vain. He asked for pen arid paper; it was gjven him; he wr ote a lelter to his sister, oonjuring her, as sbe valued her own happinesf, ber own hon0ur, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as tbeir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sorvants promised they would deljvor it; but giving it to the physici an, he th0ught it better nol to harass any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he corisidered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on witbout rost to the buſy inmates of the h0use; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notos of busy preparation. Morriing came, and the sound of carrjages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frclntic. The curiosity of the servaritſat last overcame th eir vigilance, they gradually stole clway, leoving him in the cuftody of an belpless old wornan. He seized the opporturiity, with one bourid waf out of the room, and in a moment found hjinself in the apartment where a1l were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the fjrst to perceive him: hc imrnediately opproached, and, taking his arm by forco, hurriod him from the room, speechless witb rage. Whon on the stair case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remembor your 0ath, arid know, if nat my bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So ſaying, he pushed hjm towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in searcb ofhim. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not fin ding vont, had broken a blood-uessel, ond he was convcyed to hed. This was n0t mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he eritered, os the pbysician was afraid of agitclting her. The marriage was salemnjzed, and the bride and bridogroom lefl London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood pr0duced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guclrdians might beoalled, and when the midnight hour had strvck, he related camposedly what theroclder has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it waf too late. Lord Ruthven hod djsappeared, and Aubrey's sisler had glvtted the thlrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, C0NTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE,&c.\n\"The world wcls aIl 6efore bim, where to choose his placc of rest, arid Providence hjs guide.\"\nIN Sailjng throvgh the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vesself, in the year 1812, we put irito the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certairi supply of cattle and vegelables always to be bad lhero, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and rnerchontmen; and th0ugb it lies rather out of the track for ships bound lo Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation os a voyage. We laridcd; as usual, at tho bottom of tbe bay, and wbilst the men were emp1oyed in watering, and the purser bargaining for catt1o with thenatives, thc clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been befare. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticulc so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our gulde, who told uſ he had come from Scio with an Engliſh lord, who left the iſland four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho ongagcd me as a pilot,\" soid the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choosc to quit Mitylene, where I arn likely to get married. He was an odd, hut a very good man. Tbe cottage ovcr tbe hill, facing the river, belongs to hiin, and he has lest an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there a6out fourteen months, though not conſtantly; for he sailf in his felucca very often to the different islclnds.\"\nThiſ accaunt excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kjndly receiued by an old man, wh0 conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four aparlments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawirig-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spaciaus closet annoxed. They were all simply decorated: plain greeri-stained walls, marble tables 0n either side,a large myrtle jn the centre, and a small fountain beneoth, whicb could be made to play thr0ugh the branches by moulng a spririg fjxed in the side os a srnall bron2e Verivs iri a leanirig p0sture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dazen English carie chairs, and an empty book-ease: there were no mirrors, nor a singlepainting. The bedchomber had merely a large mattress spread on the floar, with two stuffed cotton quilts and o pillow—the commori hed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed cl rnarble recess, formerly, theald man told us, filled with b0oks and papers, which were tben in a large feaman's chest in tbe claset: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exclmining the eontents. On the tabIet of the reeess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roufseau's warks compIete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in tbe German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzobue's n0vels; Schiller's play of the Rabbers;Milton's Paradisc Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in I81o; several small pamphlets from tho Greek prefs at Constantinople, much torn, but no Englifb book of any description. Mosl of tbese books wero filled with marginal notes, wrjtten with a pencil, inItalian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, arid marked with sllps of papor, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been readirig these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otherf; but,\" said he, \"lhere they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing withoul orders, ho would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwayf very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of thls farm for the trouble of tclking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottagc in the waod, clnd whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; Idon't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the hovse externally wos pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen braad, ond the fluted m arble pillars wilh black plinths and fret-work corriices, (as it is now custamary in Grecian architecture,) were considerabIy higher than tbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was couered by a fine Tvrkey carpel, benealh an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houſe-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings iri sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frvit, and enjo ying lhc evening breeze.\nOn the lest hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapcs, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the sha de os two large m yrtle bushes, a marhle seat wilh an ornamental wooden back was placed, on whlch we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said lhe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twlce a week, besides Sundays.\"\nTho vicw from this seat was whal may bo termed \"a bird's-eyo view.\"A linc of rich vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with ollve and myrtle trees in bloorn, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple app eared in mcljestio deeay. A small stream issving from the ruins descended in broken cascadcf, untll it was lost in the woods near thc mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a l jttlc on the 1oft, lhrough a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several fmallis1ands were distinctly observed, stvddirig the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominlok, his banker, whohad gone toCandia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conduotor, \"could tcll, but I am furc he will not,\"—\"And carinot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said hc, \"I dare nol.\" We hod not tiine to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnl several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had portioncd eight young girls when he was last upan tbe island, and even danced with them at tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotlon and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bougbt a new hoat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamen ts to the poor chiIdren. In short, he appe-\nared to us, from all we callected, to have been a very eccentric and benevoIent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our 0ld friend at the cottage tbought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughtor, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-sorte, and taught hcr himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from thepeaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginalions all on the rack, gucssing who thjs rambler in Groece could be. He had money it was evident: he had phi1anthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, aIl our doubtſ were dispelled. Falling in company witb Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" sald he, \"about wham you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited hlm at Milylene.\" We bad riever thcri heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years fr0m home; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calclcl in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with lhe idea of retvrning to Milylone on same future day; bul to me thclt day will never return. I make this statemerit, believing it not quite unintereſting, and in juſtice to bis lordship's good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as 0f an unfeeling dispoſiti0n, averse toassoeiating with human nature, or contributing inany way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is djreotly the reverse, as may bo plairily gathered from those little anecdotes. All tbe finer feelirigs of the heart, so elegant ly dopicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seot in his bosom. Tenderness, sym-\npathy,and charity appear to guide oll his actions: and hjs courting tbe repose of s0litude is an addjtional reason for marking him as o being 0n whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read thepreceding pleasjng \"traits\" withovt fceling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or p1eclsures, I do not assume a right to give on opinion. Reports are ever to be received with coution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsclf before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, ond shvn the world's applaufe, is the svrest testimony of a virluous heart and sclf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Wjlliam Polidori\nTHE superstilion upon which this tale is founded is very general ln the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it djd not, however, extenditself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the diuision of thc Latin and Greek ehurches; al which time, the ldea becoining prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried ln their terrilory, it gradually increased, and formed the subjeet of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rislng from their graues, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautisul. Inthe West it spread, with someslight variation, a1l over Hungary, Polclnd, Austria, and Lorraine, where the be1ief existed, thal vampyres riightly imbibed o certain portion of the blood of their victiins, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suokers fatten-\ned—and their veins became distended to such o state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March,1732, is a curlous, and, of course, credi6lo account of a particular case of vampyrism, whioh is stated to have accurred at Madreyga, in Hungory. It appears, that upon an examinalion af tbe commclnder-in-chief arid magistrates os the place, they positivoly and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certajn Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had beon he clrd to say, that, at Cassouia, onthe frontiors of lhe Turkish Servia, he had been t0rmented by a vampyre, but hadfound a way to rid himself of the evil, by ealing some of the earth out of the vclmpyre's grave, and ru6bing himself with his blood. This precclution, however, did not prevent him from becomirig a vompyre himself; for, about lwenty or thirty days after his death arid burial, many persons complained of having beeri lormented by hirn, and a depofition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attaeks. To prevent further miſchief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, t0ok up the body, and found it (as is supposed to bo usuol in cases 0f vampyrism) fresb, arid entirely free from corruption, and cmitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and slorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, lhcy resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven onlirely lbrough the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reported to have crjed out as dreadfully as if ho had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burried his body, and threw the ashes int0 his graue. The same measures were adopted with the corseſ of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lesl they should, iri their turn, become agents upon others who survlved lhem.\nThe universaI belief ls, that a person sucked by a vampyre bccomes a vampyre hjmself, and sucks in his turn.\nCbief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it ſeems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observalions than any other instance which could be adduced. Iri mclny partſ as Greece il is considered as a ſart os punjshmerit after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, thclt the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine bis infernal visitations solely to those beirigs he loved most whiIe upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded lo in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on oarth, as Vampyresent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rerit; Tben ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the 6lood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At mldnight drain thc stream os life; Yet loathe tbe banquet which perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere thcy yet expire, Shall know tho demon for their slre; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The y0ungest, best bcloved os all, Shall bless thee with a sather's name— That word shall wrap thy heart ln flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's lasl tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy gIancc must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand fhall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of whicb, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borncaway by thee Memorial os thine agony! Yetwith lhine own best bl0od shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then ſtalking to thy svllen grove, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutboy has also introduced in his wild but beautlful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre c0rse of the Arabian rnaid Oneiza, who is represeritedas hauing returned from the grave for the purposo of tormenling him she best loved whlIst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted frorn the sinfvlness of her life, she h cing pourtrayed throughout tbe wholo of the tale af o complete type os purity and innocence. The veraciovs Tournefort gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to whjch he pretends to have beeri an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upan this subject, besjdes a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustratiue of its effeets, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a clafſical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curiouſ arid interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the presont may suffice sor the liinits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and whicb may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is lhe one in most general acceptatian, there are several others fynonymous with it, made use af in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of tho dissipations attendant upon a London winter, thore appeared at the various parlles of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkablo for his singularilies, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not partioipale therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fajr only attracted his attention, that he might by cl look quell lt, and throw fear irito those breasls w here thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensatjon of awe, could nat explain whence it arose: somc attributed it to the dead grcy eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glancc to pjerce throvgh lo the inw ard workings of the heart; but fell upori the chcek with a loaden ray that weighed upon tho skin it c0uld not pass. His peculiaritios caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, arid thosewho hod been occustomed t0 vioIeril excitement, and now fell the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in lheir presence copable of engaging their attention. In spite af the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, ej lher from the blush os modesty, or from tbe strong emoliori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc female hunlers after notoriety attempted to win hjs attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of wbat they might term affection: Lcldy Mercer, who had been the mockery of every in0nster shewn in draw ing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and dld all but put on the dresſ of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—tbough in vclin:—when she stood before him, thoughhis eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, stiIl it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was bofflod, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not lhat tbe female sex was indlfferent to him: yet such waf the appa rent cautlon with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever address ed himself t0 females. He had, howover, the reputation of cl winning torigue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparenl hatred of vice, he was as often among thoſe females who farm the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those wbo sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon a young gcntlemclri of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left wilh an only sister in thepassession of great we alth, hy parents who died whilehe was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thaught it their duty merely to take care of his sortune, while tbey reljnquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mcrcenary svbalterns, he cultivatedmore his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic foeling of honour ond candour, which daily ruins so many miIliners' apprentices. He believ ed all to sympathife with virtue, and tbought that vlce was lhrown iri by Providence meroly sor the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery af a cottage mcrely c0nsisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, bvt which were bctter adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variouſ co1ourcd patches. He th0ught, in fine, tbclt the dreams of poets were the realities os lise. He was handsome, frank, ond rich: f0r these reasons, upon his entering into the gay eircles, many mothers surrounded him, striving whicb should describe with least truth thcir languishing ar romping favourites:the daughters at the same time, by their brightening c0untenances when he approached, and by tbeir sparkling eyes, when he opened his llps, soon led himinto falso nolions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to tbc romance of hif solitary hours, he was starlled clt fjnding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, riot sram the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleaſing pictvres and descriptians contained in those volumes, from which hehad formed his study. Finding, however, somc compcnsotiori in hiſ gratified vonlty, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossod him iri his career.\nHe walched him; and the vory impossibilily of forming an idea of the character os a man entirely absorbed in himsolf, who gave few other figns of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent tothoir existence, implied by the avoidanee of their contact: allowing hif imagiriation to pict ure every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, hc soan formed this object intothe hero of a romanee, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rathcr than the persan before him. He became aequainted with him, paid him attentions, and fo far advancod upon his noticc, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs wereembarraſsed, and soon sound, from the notes of preparatjon in — Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only wbetted hiſ cvriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for hjm to perforin the tour, whjch for many gcnerations has been thought necessary to enable lhe young to take some rapid stops in the carecr os vice towards putting themselveſ upon an eqvality with lhe aged, and not allowing lhem to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scclndalous intrigues are mentloned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, aceording to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately menli0ning his iritentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive froin him a propo sal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of osteem from hlm, who, apparently, had nothjng in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of sludying Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he fourid, that, though many more of his aetlons were exposed to his view, thc results affered differcnt conclvsions from the apparenl motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his li6erality;—tho idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his band more than en0ugh to relieve their immedlate wants. But Aubrey covld not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the daor with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, 0r ta sink him still deeper in his lniqvity, he was sent away with rich charily. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous lndigent. There was 0ne circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which wasstill inore impressod upon his mind: alI those upon whom it was bcstowed, inevltably sound that there was o cursc upon jl, for they were oll either led to tbescaffold, or sunk to the lowest clnd the most abject misery. At Brussels and otber lowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparont cagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashi0nable vice; there he entered into al1 the spirit os the faro table: he betted, clnd always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he l0st even more than he gained; bvt it was always with tbe same unchanging face, wilb whicb he generally watched the society arovnd: it waf not, however, sa when he encountered the rash youthfvl novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; lhen his very wish ſeemed fortune's law—this apparent a6stractedness of mind was laid aside, arid his eyes sparkled with more fire thcln that of the cat whi lst dallying wlth the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn srom thecircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fierid; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst tho speaking looks of mute hungry children, wjthout a ſingle farthing 0f his late immense wealth, wherewith to huy even sufficient ta satisfy their present cravirig. Yet he took no money from the gclinbling table; but immediately lost, to tbe rui ner of many, the last gi1der he had just sriatched from the canvulsive grasp of the innoeerit: this migbt but be the result of o certain degrec of knowledge, which was n0t, however, capable of eombating the curining of themore experienced. Aubrey often wisbed to represent this to his friend, and beg him to rofign that charlty and pleasvre which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend lo his own prosjt;—but he delayedit—for eclch day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the vari0us wild and rich scenes af nature, was alwclys the same: his cye spoke less than his lip; and tbough Au hroy was near the object of his curlosity, he obtained no greater grati fication from it than the constant excitemont of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted irnagination began to assume tbe appcarance of something supernatural.\nThey so0n arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lostsight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the mor ning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of lhe memorials of another almostdesorted city. Whjlst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, whlcb he opened with e ager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathjng nothing bvt affection; the otherf were from his guclrdians, the latler astoriished bim; if it had before entered into bis imagination lhal tbere wclsan evil power resident iri hiſ companion, these seemcd to giue him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, thathis character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his llcentious habits moro dangerous to sociely. It had been discovered, that his contempt for lhe adultress had not originclted ln hatred of her characler; but that he had reqvired, lo enhance hif gratification, thot his victim, the partner of his gvilt, should be hurled fromtbe plnnacle of vnsu1lied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degrodation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on aecount of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even thc mask aside, and had nol scrupled to oxposo the who1e deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upan leaving one, w hose character had not yet shown a single brlght point 0n which lo rest lhe eye. He resalved to invent ſome plausible prolext for abandonjng hjin a1together, purp0sing, in the mean while, to watob him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoliced. He cntered into thc same circ1e, and s0on percejved, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upan the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequcnted. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimorried femalo is mel with in society; be was therofore obliged to carry on his plaris in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all hjs windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin ofan innocent, though thoughtIess girl. Losing no time,he eritered thc apclrtment of Lord Ruthuen, and abruptly asked him his intentions wlth respect to the Iady, informing him at the same lime that he waſ aware of his being about to meet her that very riight. Lord Ruthven answered, that hls intentions were such as be supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pr essed whether he inlended to marry ber, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writ-\ning a note, to say, that from tbat moment be must decline occompanying his Lords hip iri the remainder of their praposed tour, he ordered his seruarit to soek other apartments, and calling upon the motherof the lady, informed bor of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughler, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation wof prevcnted. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans baving been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dlrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Pcninsula, soon fovnd himsclf at Athens. He theri fixcd his residence in the houso of a Greek; and soon 0ccupied himself in tracing the faded records of anciont gl0ry upon monuments that clpparently, ashamed of chronicling thc deeds of freemen only bcfore slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many ooloured lichen. Under the some roof as himself, existeda 6eing, so beautifuI and delicate, that she rnight bave formed thc model for a painter wishing to pourlray on carivass the promised hope of the failhful in Mabomet'f paradise, save thal her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong t0 those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the inountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type 0f her beauties; for who would have exchan-\nged her eye, clpparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animalsuited but to tbc taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquiljes, and 0ften would the uncoriscious girl, engaged in the pursvit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagergaze of him, who forgot the letterf he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tab let, in tho contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often w0uld her tresses falling, as she flitted arovnd, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicalely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excufc the forgetfulneſs of tbe antiquary, who let escape from hjs mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passoge in Pausariias. But why altempt to describe charms which all feel, bvt none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffocted by crowded drawirig-rooms and ſtifljng ballſ. Whilst he drew those remairis of which he wisbed to preserve a memorial for his future hovrs, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then descrjbe to him the circling danceupon lhe open plain, would paint, to hjm in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, thc marriage pornp she rememberedvicwing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects tbat hod evidently made a greater impresſion up0n her mind, would tell bim all the supcrnatural tales of her nurse. Her eamestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as ſhe told him lhc tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearesl ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely feinale to prolong his existence for lho ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attemptod to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe clted to him the names of old men, who had at last delectcd one living among themselvos, after several 0f their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and wheri she found him so inerodulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, rernarked, that those who had dared lo question thcir existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She delailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hcaring a pretty accvrate description os Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, thal there could be no truth in ber fears, though at the same time he wondered clt the many coincidences which had all lended to excitea belief in the supernotvral powor 0s Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to clttach himseIf more ondmore to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtuesof the women amorig whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wori his heclrt; and while he ridjculed the idea of a young man of English ha6ils, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to lhe almost fairy form before bim. He would tear himſelf at tjmes from her, and, forming cl plan sor some aritiquarian research, be would depart,determined not to return until his object was altained; 6ut he always found it imposslb1e to fix his attention upon theruins around him, whilst in his mind hc retained an image lhat soemed a1one the rightfvl possessor os his thoughts. Ianthe wos uriconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluetance; but it was because she had no longer ony one with wbom shc could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelcbing or uncavering somo fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealcd to her parentſ on the subject of Vampyros, arid they both, with several present, affirmed thejr existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard lhe name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass thro ugha wood, where no Greok would ever remain, after the day had closed, upori any c0nsideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their noeturnal orgies, and denounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey madc ljght of their representations, and tried to laugh thcin out of the ldea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal p0wer, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he waſ silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set aff upon his excursion unaltended; he was surprised to obsorve the melancholy foce of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, macking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them wilh such terror. Wben he was aboul to dopclrl, Iarithe came to the side of hls horse, and earnostly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in clction;—he promised. He was, however, so occupjed in his reſearch, that he dld not perceive that day-light would soon cnd, and that in tho horizon there was one of thosc spccks which, iri the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour alltheir rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these ſoulhern climates, iſ almost unknown; immediatelythe sun sets, nighl begins: and ere he had advanccd far, the power of the storm waf abovc—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy raln forced ils wcly through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forkod lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hif very feet. Svddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glarc of lightning, that he was in thc neighbourhood of a hovel thclt hardly lifted itseIf up from the masses of dead leoves and brushwood which surrounded it. Diſmountirig, he approached, hoping to firid some one to gujde him to the town, or at leaſt trusting to obtairi shclter from tbe pelting of the slorm. As he approached, tbe thunders, sor o momerit silent, allowed hlm to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stisled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was ſtar tled: but, roused by the thunder which again ralled over his heod, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door os the hut. He found himſelf in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was clpparently unperoeived; sor, though he called, still the sounds continued, ond no notice was tclken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to whlch a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose ſtrength seemed superhuinari: determined to sell hls life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against tbe ground:—bis enemy lhrew himself upon him, and kneeling up0n his breast, had placed his hands vpon bis thraat—when the glclre of many lorches penetrating through the hole lhat gclve light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rosc, and, leavlng his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the brancbes, as he broko through the wood, was rio longer beard. The storm was riow stilI; arid Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatch looded on every iridiuidual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attraoted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when tho light of thc torches once more burst upon him, to peroeive the airy forrn of his fair eonductress brought in o llfeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping tbat it was 6ut a vision arising from his dislurbed imagiriation; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was na colour upori her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet therewas a stillness about her facc that seemed almost as attaohing as lhe life that onoe dwclt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her thraat were lhe marks of teeth having opened the vcin:—to this the men painted, crying, simultaneously slruck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lltter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was loid by the side of her who had lalely been to him the object of so many bright and fairy vifions, now fallen with the flawer of life that had died within her. He knew not what hls thougbts were—his mindwas benumbed and seemed to ſhun reflection, and take rcfuge in vacanoy—he beld almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, wbich had becn found in the hut. They were soon mot by dissoront parties who hod been engaged in the se arch of her whom a mother bad missed. Their lamentable crief, as lhey approached the city, forewarned tbe paronts of s0me dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grjef would be impoſsible; but when they ascertained the cause of thcir child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inc0nsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being pul to bod was seized with a most violent fever, and was o ften delirious; iri these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthuen and upon Ianthe—by some unac countable combjnation he seemed to beg of his former coinpanion to spare the being he loved. At other timcs he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, chanced at this time to arrive at Athenſ, and, from whatever matiue, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hiinsels in the same hause, and became his constant ottendari t. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he waſ horrified and startled at the sight of him whose imoge he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kirid words, implying cllmost repentancefor the foult that had caused their separation, and slill rnore by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to hlf presence. His lordſhip seemed quite changed; he no loriger appeared that apathetic being who had so astoriished Aubrey; but as soori as bis c0nvalescence began to be rapid, he againgraduolly retired into the sclme state of mind, ond Aubreyperceived no difference from the former man, except tbat at times he was surprised lo meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his 1ips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted hiin. Dvring the last stage os lhe inualid's rocovery, LordRuthveri was apparently engaged in watching lbo tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking thc progress of those orbs, circling, 1ike our world, the moveless sun;—irideed, hc appeared to wish to avoid the eyes os all.\nAubrey's inind, by this shock, was much weakened, ond tbat elasticity of spirit wbich had once sa distinguished him now seemed to have f1ed for ever. He was now as much cl lover of folitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it jn the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidft the rujns he had formerly frequenled, Ianthe's form stood by his side—jf he s0ught it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst lhe underwoad, in quest of the modest violet; then sudderily turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wounded throat, with a mcck smile upon her lips. He determined ta fly scenes, every featuro of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himsolf bound by the tender care he had taken of him during bis ilIncss, that they shou1d viſit thoso parts of Greeee neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attachcd: bul though thcy thus haſtened fromplace to place, yet they seemed not t0 heed what thcy gazed upon. They heard muoh of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these re portſ, whlch they imaginedwere only the invention of indlvidualſ, wbose inlcrest it was to exeite the generosity of tho se whom they defended froin prelended dangers. In consequencc of thus neglectlng the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guardf, more ta servc as gvides thari as a defence. Upon enteririg, however, a narrow defile, at tho bottom os whicb was the hed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbovring precipices, they had reason to repenl their negligence;far fcarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were slortled by lhe whistling of buIlets close to thelr heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themsclves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the rep0rt came. Lord Ruthuon and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moinent behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but aſharned of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade lhem advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the ra6bers should climb above and take them in the roar, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of therock, when Lord Ruthven recoived a shotin the shou1der, which broughl him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; arid, no longer heeding the contest or his own poril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbcrs' faces around him—hif guards hauing, vpon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises os great reward, Aubrey foon induccd tbem to convey his wounded friend t0 a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their preſerice—they being content merely to gvard the entrclnoe till their comrade should return wlth the promised sum, for which he had an arder. Lord Ruthven's strcngth rapidly decreased; in two days inortisication ensued, arid deatb feemed advancing wlth hasty steps. Hls oonduct and appearance had n0t changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objeets ab0ut him: but towards the close of the last everiing, his mind became apporontly uneasy, arid his eye aften fixed upon Aubrey, who was induoed to offer hjs assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Asslst me! you may save me—you may do more than tha t—I mean not my llfe, I beed tbe death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may sove my horiour, your friend'f honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I nced but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explaln the whole—bul if you would conceal all y0u know of me, my honour were free from stain in tho world's mouth—and if my d eatb were unknown for some time in Englarid—I—I—butlife.\"—\"It shall nol be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raisirig himself withexultant uiolence, \"Swear by all your soul revcres, by all your nature fearf, swear that, fora year and a day you will not impart your knowledge af my crimes or death to any living bcing in any way, whatever may happen, or whatcver you may see. \"—His eyes seomed burstlng from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he surik laughing upon his plllow, and brealhed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did nol sleep; lhe many circumstances attendlng his acqvaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew nat why; when he remembered his oalh a cold shivering cclme avor him, as if from thcpresentiinent of som ething horrlble awaitinghim. Rising early in tho morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which be had left the corpse, when cl robher met him, and iriformed hlm that it was no longer there, having beon conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to tbe pinnacle of a neighbouring mounl, according lo a pr0mife they had given his lordship, that it fhould be exposcd t0 the flrst cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, delermined to go and bvry it upon the spot wbere it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the eorpse or the clothes, though the robhers swore they pointed oul thc identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mlnd was bewildered in conjeelures, but he at last relurned, convinced thot they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a c0vntry in which he had met with svcb terrible misfortunes, and in wbich all clpparently conspired to heighten thal superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to corivey him to Otranto, or to Napl es, he occupied himself in arrangirig those effects he had with him belongjng to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other thirigs there was a case containing severol weapons 0f 0ffence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers clnd otaghans. Wbilst turriing them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger difcovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further pr0of, he found the wcapon, and hif h0rror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarIy shaped, the shealb he hold in bis hand. His eyes seemed lo need no further certainty—they ſeemed gazing tobe bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to difbelieve; but the partioular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and shoath were alike ln splendour onboth, and left no room sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hiſ way home, at Rome, his firsl inquiries wcre concerning the lady he had atlemptod to snalch from Lord Ruthuen'f soductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since lhe departure of his lordſhip. Aubrey's mind beeame almast brokon under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady bad fallen a victim to thc destroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and bis only occupation consisted in urging tho speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, so0n wafted him to the English sh0res; and hc hasleried to the mansion of hiſ fathers,and there, for a moment, appoclred t0 lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory 0f the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she wos still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace whicb gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assomblieſ. There was none os that light bril1iancy which only exists in the heated atmoſphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the Ievity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from soine feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul c0nscious of a 6righler realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her hiſ affeclion, and would in her presence forget those griess she knew destrayed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed aſ lf those eyes,—thclt foce were then playirig in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to thc world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit thal her presentation should be delayed unti1 her br0thor's return from the continent, wben he might be her protector. It wasnow, therefore, resolued that the ncxt drawing-room, which was fast approachlng, should be the epoch af her entryinto the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rathcr have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy whicb overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivoIities osfashionable strangers, when his mind hod been ſo torn hy lhe events he had witnessed; but hedetermlned to sacrifice his own comfort to lhe protection of hiſ sister. They soon arrjved in town, and prepared for the next day, whjch had been announced as a drclwing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held sor a long time, and all wha were anxious to bask inthe fmilc of royalty, hastened thilher. Aubrey was there with his siſter. While he was ftonding in a eorncr 6y himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the fjrst time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in lhat uery place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and cl voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hard1y courage to turn, fearfvl of seelng a ſpectre that would blasl hjin, when he perceived, at a litlle distance, the same figure which had attracted hjs notice on lhis spot upon his first entry into sociely. He gazed till his limbs almost resvsing to bear their weight, ho waf obliged to take the arm of cl sriend, and forcing a passclge through the erowd, he threw himself into hiſ carriage, and was drivon home. He paoed the room with hurricd steps, and fixed hls hands upon his head, as if he wore afraid his lhoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started up in dreodful array—tho dagger—his oath.—Hc roused himself, he covld riot believe it pofsible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imaginali0n bad conjured up the image his mind wos resting upon. It was impossible lhat it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he atlempted to ask conoerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succoed in gaining informaljon. He went a few nightf aftcr with his fister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protectiori of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his 0wn devouring thoughls. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to him those featureſ he moft abhorred. He sprclrig forward, seized hjs sister's arm, and, with hurried step, sorced her towards the street: al the door be found himself lm peded by the crowd of servanls who werewaiting for their lords;and whlle he was engaged in pafsing thcm, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Roinember yovr aath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sifter,soon reached home.\nAubrey became olmost dlstracted. If before his mind had been ahsorbed by one subject, how much inorc complelely was it eng-\nrossed, now tbat the certainty of the monster's Iiving agajn pressed upon bis thoughts. His sister's attentioris were now unheeded, clnd it was in vain tbat she intreated him to exp1ain to her what bad caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. Tbe more he thought, the more he was bewildored. His oath starlled him;—was be then lo allow this monster to roam, boaring ruin upon his breath, amjdst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His vcry sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose hif suspicions, who would believe him? He tbought of employing his own hand to free theworld from fuch cl wretch; but death, he rememhered, had been alreody mocked. For days he remained in this state; sbut up in his ro0m, he saw no one, and clte only whon biſ sister came, who, with eyeſ streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, t0 support nature. At last, no longer capablo os bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from slreet to street, anxious to fly lhat image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often expafod to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned wlth lhe evening to the house; but at last helaid him down to restwherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, arixious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursucr fwifter than any—from lhought. His conduel, however, sudderily ehanged. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his sriends, with a fiend amongst them, of wh0se presence lhey were unconscious, he dotermined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all wh0m Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he enlered inlo a raom, his ha ggard and suspicious looks were so striklrig, his inward shudderings sa visihle, thal his sister was at Iast obligcd to beg os him to abstairi from seeking, for her fake, a society which affected him ſo strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailirig, lhe guardians thought propcr to interpose, and, fearing that his mirid was becoming alienated, they lhought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon thein by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufserings he had da ily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they oonsidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constont care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so cornpletely was his mind abforbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so greal, that ho was consined t0 hls cbarnber. There he would often lic for dclys, incapa6le of being roused. He had bec0me emaciated, his eyes had attaincd a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affcction and recoIlection rcmaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sisler; then he wou1d sometimes start, and, soizing her hands, with looks that severely afflictod her, ho would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not t ouch him—if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" clnd again he fank into a state, whenoe not even she could rouse him. Thif lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohe-\nrences became less frequerit, and his mind threw off a p0rtion of its gloom, whilst his guardians ahserved, that several tiines in the day he would courit upon his f ingers a definite number, and theri smile.\nThe tlme had nearly elapsed, when, upan the last day of the year, one of his guardians eritering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his sister was going next day t0 be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously lo whom. Glad of this mark af returning iritellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, lhey mentioned lhe name of tbe Earl os Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met wjth in society, Aubrey soemed pleasod, and astonished them still morc by his expressing his intenti0n to be present ot the nuptials, and desirjng to see his sifter. They answered not, but in a few miriutes his sistor was with him. He was apparently again capabIe of being affected by the influence of her love1y smjle; for he pressed her to his 6reast, and kisfed hcr cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's heing once more alive to the feelings ofaffectiori. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to corigralulate her uponher marriage with a person ſo diftinguished for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; 0pening it, what was his surpriſe at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influericed his llfe. He scized the portrait in a paroxysm af ragc, and trampledit under foot. Upon ber asking bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husbclrid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on hcr with a frantio exprefsion of countenarice, he bade her swear lhat she would never wed this monster, for he— But be could not advance—it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thlnking Lord Ruthven was near him bvt saw no one. In the meantimo the guardians and physicion, who had heard tbe whole, and thought this was but a return of his disordcr, entered, and forcing himfram Miss Aubrey, desirod her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of thein to delay bul for one day. Tbey, attributlng this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven hadcalled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been rcfused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ilI health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exvltation and pIeclsure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this inf0rmation. He hastened to the houfe of his former coinpanian, and, by constant attendance, clnd the pretcnceof great affection for the brother and interest in his sate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who cauld resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils ta recount—could speak of himsclf as of an indiuidual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whomho addressed himself;—could tell h0w, since be knew hor, his existerice, had begun to seem worlhy of prefervation, if it were merely that ho might listen to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was tbe will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, hc obtained an important embossy, which served as an excuse for hastening tbe marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to tclke place the very doy before his departure for tho continent.\nAubrey, when he wos left by the phyſician arid his guardians, attempted to bribe the scrvants, but in vain. Hc asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sifter, canjuring her, as she valuod her own happiness, her own honour, arid lhe horiour of those now in the grave, who onccheld her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their houſe, to delay 6ut for a few hours lhat marrjage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servclnts promised they would de1iver it; but giving it lo the phyfician, he thought it better not ta harass any more tbe mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night paſsed 0n without rest to the 6usy inmates of the house; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may more easjly he conceived than described, tbe n0tos of busy preparation. Morning came, and thc sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almosl frantic. The curiosity of the servclnts ot last ouercame their uigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the cuftody of an helpleſs old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly afsembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his orm by force, hurried him from the room, speeohleſs with rage. When on the slaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oatb, and kriow, if not my bride to day, yovr sisler is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pvshed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not fjnding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bod. Thls was not mentioned to his sistor, who was not present when he entered, as the physiciari was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom lest London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sistcr'ſ guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour bad struck, he relatod cornposodly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastenod to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disclppeored, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst os a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER,CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all beforehim, where to choose hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board oneof his Majesty's vessels, in tbe year 181z, we put into the harbour os Mityleno, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo and vegelclbles always ta be had there, induce mclny British vessels to visit it—botb men of war and merohantmen; and though lt lies rather out of the trock for shipſ bovnd to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Wc landed; as usual, at tbe bottom of the bay, and whilst the mcn were employed in watering, and lhe purser bargaining for cattle wilh the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave calIed Homer's Sohool, and other places, wbere we had been before. Ori the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and erigaged a young Greck as our guide, who told us hc had come from Scio witb an English lord, who left tbe island four days previous to our arrival in hiſ felvcca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sajd lhe Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not ohoose to quit Mitylene, where I ain likely to gct married. He was an add, but a ucry good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs t0 him, and he has left an old man in cbarge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (aboul Lz50 English currency,) and has reſided there about fourteen months, though not conslantly; for he sails ln his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haslening tolhe house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us ovor the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hclll, a drawing-room, a silting parIour, and a bod-room, with a ſpaci0us closel annexed. They were all siinply decorated: plain greeri-stajned walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, whlch could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leariing posture; a large couch or sofa comp1eted the furniture. In tho haIl stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an ompty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single pclintlng. The bedchambor had morely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stusfed colton quilts and a pillow—the co mmon bed throughout Greeco. In the sitting-room wo observed amarble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were lhen in a large seaman's chest in the cl0set: it waſ open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kolzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Last, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English hook of any description. Most of these books were filled with margjrial notos, written with a pencil, ln Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all ouer, and marked with slips of paper, on wbich also were romarks.\nThe 0ld rnan said: \"The lord had been readlng these books lhe evening before he sailed, and forgot t0 place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there thoy must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thjng withovt orders, be wovld frown upon me for a week logether; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm far tbe trouble of takirig care of il, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeniari who resjdes in a small cottage in the wood, and wbom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for whal reason.\"\nThe appearance of the bouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty pac es long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pIinthf and fret-work cornices, (as jt is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were o0nsiderahly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stonc balustradc, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning af strong coarse linen. Most of the house-lops are lhus furnished, as upon thom the Greeks pass their evenirigs in smoking, dr inking light wines, such cls \"lachryrna christi,\" eating frujt, and enj0ying the ovening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the hause, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, orangeſ and 1imes were clustering togcther on its borderf, and under tho shade of two large myrtle 6ushes, a marble seat with an 0rnamental wooden back was placed, on which we wero tol d, the lord passed many of his evenings and nigbts till twelve o'clock, rooding, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppo se,\" soid the old man, \"praying\" for he was very dovaut, \"and always attended our church twice a week, 6esides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vlneyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle treef in bloom, and on tho suminit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestjc decoy. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woodf near lhe mountain's base. Tho fea smaoth as glass, and an borizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termiriates the uiew in front; anda little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and pcllm-trees, sevcral small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light bluc wave with spots os emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a vjow moro than I did tbis; but our enquiries were frultless as to the name of the porson who had resided in this romantic solilude: none knew his name but Domlnick, his banker, who had garie to Cclndia. \"The Armenian,\" sclid our conductor, \"could tcll, bvt I amsure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old frierid?\" said I—\"If I oan,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visil lhe Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt soveral particulars of the is0lated lard. He had portioned eight young girls when he wos last upon the island, and even danccd with lhem at the nuptial feast. He gave cl cow to one man, horses to otbers, and cotton and silk lo the girls who live by weaving theſe artlcles. Healso bought a new boat for a fjsherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamenls to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from oll we collected, to have been a veryecccntric arid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, whjch our old friend at the cottage th ought proper not to disclose. He had a mast beautiful daughter, with whorn the lord was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful is1e of MityIenc; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. Hc had mo ney it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all thase eccentrjcities whieh inark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were difpelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, wbo had beon travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said be, \"aboul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travelson the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at MityIene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chllde Harolde\" being put inlo our hands we recognized the recluse 0f Calcla in e vory page. Deeply did we regret n0t having been more curious in our rcsearches at the cottage, but we consoled aurse1ves with the idea of returnjng lo Milylene on some future day; butto me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite unintcresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, whichhas been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeoling diſposition, averſe to associating with human nature, or contributing iri ariy way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathored from these llttle clnecdates. All the finer foelings of the heart, so elegclntly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their soat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actians: ond his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a beirig on whose heart Religion bath sel her seal, and over whose head Bencvolence hath throwri her montle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to hif loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reparts are ever to be received wjth caution, particularly when directed againsl man's moral integrily; and he wbo dares juftify himself before that awsul tribunal whcre clll must appear, alone may cenſure the errors of a fellow-rnortal. Lord Byron's cbaracter is warthy of his genius. To do good in fccret, ond shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.",

In the West it spread, with some slight variation, aIl over Hungary, Poland, Austria, ond Lorralne, where the beIief existed, thclt vampyres njghtly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilft these human blood-suckers faltened—and tbeir velns became distended to svch a stote of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very p0res of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, l732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a partjcular case of vampyrism, whioh is stated to have occvrredat Madreyga, iri Hungary. It appeclrs, that upon ari cxamination of the commander-iri-ohief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affjrmed, lhot, aboul fivo years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pclul, had beeriheard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented bya vclmpyre, but had faund a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of thc vclmpyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from bccoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after hiſ death and bu rial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that fovr persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischies, tbe inhabitants havjng consuIted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (cls is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting clt the mou th, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having beeri thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driveri entirelythrough the beart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he if reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he bad been alive. This done, they cul off his head, burried his body, and threw the ashef into his grave. The same measvreſ were adopted with thc corses of those pe rsons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in tbeir turn, becoine agents upon olhcrs who survived them.\nThe univerfal belief if, that a person suckod by a vampyre becomes a vampyre hiinself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThls monstrous rodomontade is bere rclated, beocluse it seems better adapted to illustrclte the subjeot of the present observatjonf lhan any other instarice which could be adduced. In many parls of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftcr death, sor some helnous crime committed whilſt in oxistence, that the deceased is not orily doomed to vampyrise, but c0rnpeIlcd lo oonfine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he lovod most while upon eorth—those to whom be was bound by ties of kindred and affectian.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut firſt on oarth, as Varnpyre scnt,Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt tbenative placo, And suck tbe blood of all thy rclce; Tbere from lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streom of 1ife; Yet loalhe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy viclims, ere they yet expjre, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou curfjng them, Thy flowers are withered on tho ſtem. But ono that for thy crime must fall, Theyourigest, besl beloved of all,Sball bless thee with a fathor's riame— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou musl cnd thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—ber eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowcd hand shall teclr The tresses 0f her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest p1edge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memor ial of tbine agony! Yel with thine own best hlood shall drip; Thygnaſhing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits r ave, TilI these in horror shrink away Fram spectre moro accursed lhan they.\nMr. Southey has als0 inlroduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalclba,\" tbe vampyre oorse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having roturned froin tbe grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But lhis cannotbe supposed to have rosulted from the sinsulness of her life, fhe being pourtrayed throughout the wh0le of lhe tale as a c0mplete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefortgives a 1ong account in hif trclvels of seueral astonishing cases of vainpyrism, to wbich he prelends to have been an eyowitness; and Calmet, in his greal wark upon this subject, hosides a varioty of anecdotes, and trodilionary narratjves illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, lending lo prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition mlght be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessorily devoted to explanation, clnd which may n0w be concluded hy merely remarking, that tho ugb the lerm Vampyre is the one in most gencral acceptation, thero are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: af Vrouc0locha, Vclrdoulocha, Gou l, Broucolokcl, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happenedlhat in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at thc various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. Ho gazed upon tho rnirth around bim, as if he could not partlcipate therein. Apparently, the light laughtcr of the fair only ottracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those hreasls whero thoughtleſsness rejgned. Thoſe who feIt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fjxing upon the object's foce, did not seemto penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings af the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leclden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarilies causcd him to be invited to every bouse; all wisbod to see him, and tboso who had been accvstomed to violent exoiteinent, and now felt tbe weight af ennui, wero pleased at hauing something in their preſence capabIe of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of hiſ face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though ils form and outline were boavtiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety altempted to win his attentlons, and gain, at least, sorne marks of whcltthey might term affeolion: Lady Mercer, who had been the moekery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms sinee her marriage, throw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attroct his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were clpparently flxed upori her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceiucd;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and sbe left lhe field. But though the eommon adultress could not influence even lhe guidance of hiſ eyes, it was nat that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent coution witb which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. Hehad, howeuer, the roputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular charoct er, or that they werc moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females wh0 form lho boast of their sexfrom their domestic virtues, as clmong those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Lond0n a young genlleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister iri the posseſsion of great weallh, by parents who died while be was yet in childhood. Left also lo himself 6y guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortuno, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of meroenary ſuhalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feellng of honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thovght thal vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, os wc seo in romances: he thought lhat the miſery of a cottage merely consisled ln the vesting of clothef, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patoheſ. He thought, in fine, lhat the dreams of poets were the realitios os life. He was handsome, frank, arid rich: for these reasons, upan hls entering jnto the gay circles, mariy mothers surrounded hirn, striving which shouId describe with least truth their languishlng or romping fovourites: the daughtersat the same time, by their brightening countenances wheri he approached, and 6y their sparkling eyes, when he apened bis lipf, soon led him into false notioris os his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romanee of his solltary hours, he was startled at fjnding, lhat, except in the tallow clnd wax candles that slickered, notfrom the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in real life sor any of tbat congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he bad formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he waſ about to relinquish his dreams, whon the extraordinary being we have above describod, crossed blm in his careor.\nHe watched him; and the very impossjbility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himsels, who gave few other signs 0f his obscrvatiori of external objects, lhan the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginaliori to picture euery thing that flattered its pr0pensity to extravagant idecls, he soon formed this object inlo the hero of a romance, clnd determined t0 obserue the ofsspring 0f bis fancy, ralher than the person before him. He bocame acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that hiſ presence was always recogriised. He gradually learnt thot Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notef of preparation in — Street, that he was clbout to travel. Desirous of gclining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, bad only whetted his curiosity, hchinted ta his guclrdians, lbat jt was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generatjons has been thought necessary to enable lbe yovng to take some rapid steps in tbe car eer of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, arid not allowing them ta appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewri in carrying them on. They consented: and Au6rey iminediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surpriscd to receive frorn bim a proposal to join him. Flaltered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nolhing in common with other men, he gladly accc pted it, and in a few dayf lhey had passed the circling waters.\nHjtho-\nrto, Aubrey had bad no opporturiity os stvdying Lord Rvthven's character, and n0w he found, tbat, thougb many moro of hiſ actions were expofed to his view, the results offered different conclusiaris from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion waſ profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough lo relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upan the virtuous, rcduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppresfed sneers; but when the prof1igclte came to ask som clhjng, nol to relieve his wants, but to allow hiin to wallow in his lust, or to sink himstill deeper in hiſ iniquity, he was sent away with ricb charity. This was, however, clttributed by him to tho greater importuriity of the viciaus, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuouf indigent. There was one circumstance about the cbarity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for lhey were all cither led to thc scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns thr0ugh which they passed, Aubrey was surprized ot the apparent eagerness wilh which his companion fougbt for the centres of a1l fashionable viee; there he entered into all the spirit of the farotable: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was alwoys with the same unchonging faco, with which he generally watchcd tbe socjety around: lt was not, however, so when be encouritered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fother of a num erous family; then his very wish seemed fortune'ſ law—this apparent abslractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sporkled with more fire than that of the eat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, heleft the formerly affluent youth, lorn froin the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the folitude of a dungeon, the fclte that had drawn him within the reclch of this fiend; whilst many a fother sot frantic, amidst the speaking 1ooks of mute hungry children, withovl o sirigle farthlng of his late immense wcalth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present c rauing. Yet he took no money from the gombling table; bul immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, the last gilder he had just snatehed from the convulſive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, wbich waſ not, howevcr, capclble of eombating the cunning of the mare experienced. Avbrey often wished to represent this to his frlend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleclsure wbjch proved the ruin of all, and did nol tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking srankly and openly to him; h0wever, thif never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carrlage, and amidst the various wild clnd rich soenes of nalure, was alwayf the same: hls eye spoke less tban his lip; clnd though Aubrey was neclr the object of his curiosity, he obtained no grcater gratificati on from it tban the conslonl oxcitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hif exalted imagincltion hegan to assume the appearance of something supernalural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of hiſ companion; he left him in dally attendorice upon the morning circle of an Italian eountess, whllst he went in soarch of the memorials of another almost deserled city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he openedwilh eager impatience; the first was from his sisler, breathingnothirig bul affeclion; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it hadbeforo entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him suffioient reason for the belief. His guardlans insisted upon his lmmediately leaving his frierid, and urged, that his character was drea dfully vicious, for that the poſsession os irreſistible powers of seduction, rendered his liccntious habits more dongerovs to society. It had been discovered, tbat his conlempt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred 0f her cbaracter; but that he hod required, to enharice his gratification, that his vlctim, tho partner of his guilt, should be hurled froin the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowesl abysf os infamy and degradcltion: in flne, that all those females whom he had sought, apporently on account of lheir virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deforinity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubroy determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjngle bright point on which lo rest thc eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretextfor abandoning him altogether, purp0sing, jn the mean whilc, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight circvmstanccs pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordſhip was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly freqverited. InItaly, it is seldomthat an unmarricd female is met with in ſociety; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in seeret; but Aubrey's eye followed hjm in all his windings, and soon discovcred that an assignation had been appointed, whicb wouId most likely end in the ruin of an innocenl, though thoughlless girl. Losing no time, he ontered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, insorming him at the same time that he was awclre of his being about ta meet hor that very night. Lord Ruthven answored, that his intentlons were ſuch as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whethcr he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retlred; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fr0m that moment he must decline aecompclnying his Lordship in the reinainder of their prop0sed tour, he ordered his servant to seok other apartmenls, and calling upon the molher of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to ber daughter, but also eoncerning the character of his Lordship. Tbe assjgnatiori was preventcd. Lord Ruthven next dcly merely senl his servant to notjfy his completo assentto a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interp0sition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his ſteps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon f0und himself ol Atbens. He tben fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, asbamed of ehronjcling thedeeds 0f freemen only before slaves, hcld hidden themselves beneatb the sheltering soil or many col-\noured lic hon. Under the same ro0s cls himfelf, existed a being, so beautiful and doljeale, that she might have formed the model for a painter wjshing to pourtray on canv-\nass the promiscd hope of thcfaitbful ln Mahomet's paradjse, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any 0ne to lhi nk she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one wauld have thovght lhe gazel1e a poor type of her boauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of clnimated nature, for that sleepy luxuriovs look of the ariimal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acc0mpanied Aubrey in bis search afler antiquilief, and oftcn would the vnconſciovs girl, erigagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere bvtterfl y, show the whole beavty of her form, floating as il were upon the wirid, tathe eager gaze of him, who forgot the lettcrs he had just decyphered upon an aImost effaced tablet, in the contemplaliori of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, aſ she flitted arourid, cxhibit in tho sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swjftly fading hues, it might well excufe the forgelfu1riess of the antiquary, who letescclpe from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital jmportance to tho proper interpretatiori of o passage in Pausanios. But why attompt to describe charms whicb all feel, but none cari appreciate?—It was innocenoe, yauth, and beauty, unaffected by orawded drawing-ro0ms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserue a memorial for his fvture hours, sbe wovld stand by, and wotch thc magic effects of hif pencil, in traoing the scenes of her ncltive place; she would then describe to him the circling dancc upori the open pIain, would paint, lo him in all the glowing colours of youthful memor y, themarriage pomp she rememhered viewing in her infancy; and then, lurning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tcll him all the supematural tales of hcr nurse. Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and 0ften as she told bim the tale ofthe living vampyre, who hcld passed years amjdst his frierids, arid dearest ties, forced every ycar, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to p rolong his existonce for the ensuing mariths, his blood would run cold, whilsthe attempted to laugh her oul os such idle and horrible fantasics; but Ianthe cited to him the names os o1d men, who had at last detected one living among thcmselvos, after several of their near relativef and childreri had been found marked wilh the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when sbe found him so incredulous, she begged of him to belleve her, for it had 6een, remarked, that lh0se wbo had dared to queslion their existence, always had some proos giuen, which obliged them, witb grief and heartbreaking, to confess lt was true. She detailed to him the traditiona1 appcarance of lhese monsters, and his horr0r was increosed, by hearirig a pretty accurate doscription of Lord Ruthven; be, however, still persisted in persuading her, lhat thcrc could bo no lruth iri her fears, thaugh at the same time he wondered ot lhe many coincidences which had al1 tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began lo attach himſelf moreand inore to Ianthe; her innoeence, ſo c0ntrasted with all the offecled virtues of the women among whom he had sought f0r hjs vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea 0f a young man of Englisb hahits, marrying ari uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and morc attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear hirnself at times fram her, and, formjng a plan for some antiquarjan research, he wovld depart, determined not to return until his object was clttained; but be always faund it impossihle to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retainedan imoge that seemed alono the rightfuI possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infanli1e bejng he had first known. She always seerned to part from him with reluctance; but it was becavse she had no longer any one with whom she could visither favourite havnts, whi1st her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructiue hand of timo. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and lhey both, wilh several present, affirmed their existerice, pale witb horror at lhe very name. Soon after, Aubrey determjned to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, wherc no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impendingupon him who dared to cross thejr path. Aubrey made light os thcir representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; 6ut when he saw lhern shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of whichapparently made their blood freeze, he was silont.\nNexl morriing Aubrey set 0ff vpon his exo-\nursion unattended; hc was surprised to observe the melancholy face of hjs bost, and was concerned to find that his words, mooking the 6elief of those borrible siendſ, had irispired themwith such terror. When he was about to depart, Iarithe came to lho side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to retvrn, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; —he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the harizon there waſ one of tboſe specks which, in the warmer climcltes, s0 rapidly gathcr irito a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at lasl, however, mounted his horse, determinod to make upby speed sar his delay: but it wos too lato. Twilight, in these southern cIimates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere ho had advanced far, the power of lhe storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interv al of rest—its lhick hea vy rain forced its way through the canopying faIiage, whilst the blve forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and be was carried with dreadsul rapidity through the entang1ed forest. The animal al last, thraugh faligue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neigh6ourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from themasses of dead leaves and brvshwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to tbe town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from thc pelting of the storm. As hc approached, the thuriders,for o moment silent, all0wed him to hear the dreadsul shrieks of a woman mingling with lhe stlfled, exultant mockery of a laugh, conlinued ln one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the tbunder which agalri rolled over his he ad, he, with a sudden effort, foreed open the door of the hut. He found hjmself iri utter darkness: the soun d, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds cantinued, and no notice was laken of bim. Hc sound hlmself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voioe cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himſelf grappled by one whose strongth seemed svperhuman: deterinined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but lt was in vain: he was listed from his feet and hurled with enormovs force ag ainst the ground:—his enemy threw himsolf upan hlm, andkneeling upon his breast, had placed hiſ handsupon his throat—when theglare of many torchos penetrating through the holo that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crasbing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, wos no 1onger heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; tbe light of their torches feIl upon the mud walls, and the thatch l0aded on everyindividual straw with hcavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey thoy searcbed for her who had attracled him by her cries; he was agoin left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more 6urst upon bim,to perceive thc airy form of his fair cond uctress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arisirig from hif distvrbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cbeek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness aboul her face that seeined almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt tbere:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throot were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pojnted, crying, simultaneously struck wilh horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litterwas quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the slde of her who had lately bcen to him the objcct of so many bright and fairy vlsians, now sallen with the flower of life that hod died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—hif mlnd was benumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and take refuge in vacaricy—he beld almost unc0nsciously in his hand a nakcd dagger of a particular construction, whieh had been found in thc hut. They wcre soon met bydlfferent parties who had 6een engagcd in the fearch of ber whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable crles, as thcy approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadfvl catastrophe. —To describe their gries would be impassible; bul when they ascertained the cause os their child's dealh, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolclblc; bolh diod broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violcnt fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Rvthven and upon Ianthe—by some uriaccounlable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions up0n his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chonced at this time t0 arrive at Athens, and, from wbotever motive, upon bearing of the state of Aubrey, immcdiateIy pIaced himself in the same house, and becarne his constant attendant. When the latler recovered from his delirium, hewas horrified arid startledat the sight of him whose image he had now combjned with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had causod tbeir separation, and still more by the attention, clnxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciIed him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathotic being who had so astonisbed Aubrey; but as soon as his convalefcence began ta be rapid, he again gradually rotired lnto the same state of mirid, and Aubroy perceived no difference from the former man, excepl that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inalicious exultation playjng upon his lips: he knew not why, but thiſ smile haunted hlm. During the last stageof the invcllid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tldeless waves raised by the coo1ing breeze, or in marking the progross of tbose orbs, circling, like our world, the movelosf sun;—indeed, he appeored to wlsh to avoid the eyes os all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elaslicity of spirit which had 0nee so distiriguishod him riow seemed to hclve fled sor ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; 6ut much as he wished forsolitude, his mind could not find il in the neighbourhood os Athenſ; if be sought it amidst lhe ruins he had formerly frequented, Iclnthe's form stood by his side—if he sought lt in tbe woods, ber light step would appear waridering ainidst thcvnderwood, in quest of tho modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would ſhow, lo his wiId imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meok smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed lo Lord Ruthven, to whom hc held himself b0und by the tender care he had taken of him during hls illness, lhat they should visit those parts of Greece neithcr had yet seon. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to wbich cl recolleotion could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed nol to heed what thoy gazed up0ri. Thcy heard muoh os r0bbers, but they gradualIy began to slighl these reports, whiob tbey imagincd were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the genorosity of lhose whom they defended from pretcnded dangers. In consequence 0f thus neglecting lhe advice of lho inhabitarits, on one occasion they trauelled with 0nly a few gvards, m0re to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, howeuer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, wlth large masfes of rock brought down from the neighbovring precipioes, they had reason to repent their negligenco; for scclrcely were the whole of the pclrty engaged ln tho narrow pass, wheri they were startIed by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echood roport of several guris. In an instant the ir guards had left them, and, placing lheinselves behind rockf, had begun to fire jn lhe direction whence the reporl came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating tbeir example, retired for a moment behind the sbeltering turn of tbe defile: 6ut ashamed of being lhus dctained by a foe, who with insultlng ſhouts bade thom advance, and being exposed to unresisling slavghter, if ariy of the robbers should cliinb above and take thein in the rear, they determined at once to rush sorward in soarch of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter os the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to lhe ground. Aubroy hastened to his asfistance; and, no longer heeding the contestor hjs own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around bim—his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's beirig wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great rcward, Aubrcy soon induced them to convey hjs wounded sriend to a noighbouring cabin; and having agrecd upon a rans0m, he was no more disturbed 6y their presence—they being content inerely la guard the entrance till their comrode sbovld return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in tw0 days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appearance had not changod; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towords the olose of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and bis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who wos indueed to ofser his assistance with more than usual earneftness—\"Assist me! y0u inay save me—yov may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the declth of my existence af little as that of the passing day; but you may save rny honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I wauld do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannol explain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me,my honour were free sromstain ln tbe world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried lbe dying man, raising himself with exvltantvi0lcncc, \"Swoar by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and cl day you wi1l not impart your knowledge of my crjmos or death to any living bcing in any woy, whatever may happen, or whotever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swcar!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hjs pillow, and breathed no more.\nAuhreyrelired lo rest, but did not sIeep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with thls man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oatb a cold shivcring came over him, as is from lhc preſontiment os s0mething horrible awaiting him. Rising oarly in the m0rning, he was about to entcr lhe hovcl in which he had left the corpse, when a rob6er mot him, and informed hiin that il was no longer there, having becn conveyed by hjmself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacIe of a neighbouring mount, according to a pr0mise thcy had given his lordſhip, that it sbould be expofed to the first cold ray of themoon lhat rose after his death. Aubrey aslonished, and takirig several af the men, determined to go and bury it upon tho spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the fummit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointod out the identical rock on whjch they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried lhe corpse for the fake of thc cIothes.\nWeary of a country iri which hc had met with such terrible misforturies, and in wbich all appareritly conspired to heighten that superftitious melarichoIy that had seized upon hif mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While wait ing for a veſsel to oonuey him to Otranta, or to NapIes, hc occupied himself in arranging those efsects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst 0ther things there was a case conlaining several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggersand atagbans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprife at sindjng a sheath apparently ornamented in the ſame style as tbe dagger discovcred in the fatcll hut—he shuddered—hastenlng to gain further proof, he found lhe weapon, ond hjs harror may be imagined when he discovered that itfitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath heheld in his hand. His eyes seemed lo need no furthcr certainty—thcy seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same uarying tints upon the hafl and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and loft no room for doubt; thcre were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hls way home, at Rome, his first jnquiries were coricerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthuen's seductive arts. Her parents were in distrcss, their fortvne rulned, and she had not been h eard of since the departure of his lordship. Avbrey's mind become almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that thiſ lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He bocame morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in vrging the speed of tbe postilioris, as if he were golng to saue the life of ſome one he held dear. He arrived at Ca1ajs; a breeze, wbich seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Engllsh shores; and he hclslcned to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the paft. If she before, by her infantine carcsses, had gained his affection, now that the woman 6egan to appear, shc was still more attachirig as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowdcd apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind berieath. There was a molancholy eharin abo ut it which did not seem lo arise from miffortune, but srom some feeling within, that clppeared ta indicate a soul conscious of a brigbter realm. Her step was not that li ght footing, which strays where'er a butterflyor a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was neverbrightened 6y the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection,and would in her presence forget tbose griefs she knew destroyed hiſ rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that 0s the volvptvclry? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were then playjng in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteon, and had not been presented t0 the world, it having heen thought by hcr guardians more fit that her presentatlon should be delayed untiI her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, lheresore, resolued lhat the next drawing-room, whicb was fast appraachirig, should be the epoch os her entry into the \"busy scerie.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansian of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy whioh overpowored him. He could not feel interest abovt the frivolitles of fashionable strangers, when his mind had beeri so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determiried to sacrifioe his own o0mfort to the proteclion of his sister. They soon arriv od in town, andprepared for the next day, whieh had boen anri0unced as a drawing-room.\nThe c rowd was excessjve—a drawing-rooin had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himfe1f, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembronce that the first time he had seen Lord Ru thven wos in that very place—he felt himself suddenly ſei2ed by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast hlm, when he pcrceived, at a little diſtance, the same figure whicb had clttracted his notice on thif spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm os a frlend, and forcing a passage through tbe crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven bome. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fjxed his hands upon his head, of if he wcre afraid his thoughts were bursting from hjs brain. Lord Ruthven again before hiin—cireumstances storled up ln dreadful arroy—lhe dagger—his oath.—He roused himself, he oould not believe jt possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imaginalion had corijured up the imagc his mind was reſting upon. It was impossible that it could bo real—he determined, thcrefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he oould not succeed in gainirig information. He went a few riights after with his sisler to the assembly os anear relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he relired into a recefs, and there gave himself up to his own devou-\nring thoughts. Pereeiving, clt last, that many were leoving, he roused himself, andentering another room, found hjs sister surrounded by severaI, appareritly in earnest conversatiori; he altemptod to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to himthose features he rnost abhorrcd. He sprang forward, soized hjs sister's arm, and, with hurricd step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himse1f impeded by the crowd of seruants who werewalting for their lords; and while he was engaged ln passing them, he again hcard that voice whispcr close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached borne.\nAubrey became a1most distraoted. If before his mind had been absorbed 6y one subject, how much moro completely was il engrossed, naw that the certainty of the monfter's living again pressed upon his thaughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in valn that sbe inlreated him to explain to her what had coused his abrupt conduct. He on1y uttered a few words, and those terrified hor. The more hc th0ught, the more he waf bewildered. His oath startled hlm;—washe thon to allow this monster to roam, bearing rujn upon his breath, amidst all he helddear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touchod by him. But even if he wore to break his oath, and discl0se his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employirig his own hand tofree the wor1d fromsuch a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For dayf ho rernained in this stote; shut up in his room, he saw rio one, and ate only when his siſter camo, who, with oyes streaming with tears, besought hiin, for her sake, to support natvre. At last, no longer eapable of bearing stillness and solitude,he left his house, roclmed from street lo street, anxi0us to fly that image which baunted him. Hiſ dress become neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day svn as to the inidnight damps. He was no longer ta be recognized; at fjrst he returned with the evening lo tbe house; but at lclsthe laid him down to rost wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to fol1ow him; but they wore ſoon distanoed by him who fled from a purfuer fwifter than any—from thought. His conduot, however, suddenly changed. Struck with tbe idea that he left by his absencc lhe whole 0f hjs friends, with a fiend amongsl them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into s0ciety, and watch him closely, anxious to forewam, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached wilh intimacy. Bul when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, hjs inward fhudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society whioh affected him so strongly. When, hawever, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thoug ht proper to interpose, and, fearing thal his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high tjme to resume again that trust which bad been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parerits.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injurios and sufferings he had daily encouritered in his wanderings, and of prcventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks ofwhat they considered folly, they erigaged a phyſician to reside in tbe house, and take conslanl care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, s0 completely was his mirid absarbed by one terrible subject. His jncoherence became at lasl so greal, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would ofteri lie for days, incopable of being roused. He had become emaciatod, bis eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only fign of asfection andrecollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimeſ start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her nol to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love for me is aught, do not go near hlm!\" When, however, she inquired to whom hc roferred, his only anfwcrwas, \"True! true!\" and again he sank lnto a slate, whence n0t even she couId rause hlin. Thjs 1asted many monthf: gradually, howover, as the year was passing, his incoherencos becarne less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite numbor, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the lclst day of the year, one of his gvclrdians eritering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situatjon, when hif sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of relurning intellect, of which they feared be had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be prescnt clt the nuptials, and desiring to see his sisler. They answered not, but in a few minvtes his sister was with him. Hewaf apparently again capabIe of being affectedby the lnfluence of her 1ovely smile; for he pressed her ta his breast, and kissed hcr cheek, wet with tearf, slowing at the thought of her brolher's being once moro alive to the feelings of affection. Ho began to speak with all hiswonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriago with cl person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived o locket upon her breast; apening it, what was his surprjse at beholding the features of lhe monster who bad so long influenced his life. He seized the portrclit in a paroxyſm of rage,and trampled it under foot. Upon her aſking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her fvture husband, be looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her wjth a frantie expression of cauntenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monfter, for be— But he could not advance—it seemed as if that voice again bade him rcrnember his aath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was neor him but saw no one. In the meantime the gvardions and physician, who had hcard thc whole, and thought this was but a returri of his disorder, entered, ond forcing him fram Mifs Aubrey, desired her to leave him. Ho sell upon his kriees to them, he jmplored, he begged of them to dclay but for 0ne day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had takeri poſsession of his mind, endeclvoured to pacify him, and relired.\nLard Ruthven had calledthe morning after the drawing-room, and had been refusod with every one eIse. When he heard of Aubrey's ill bealth, he recldily understood himsolf to be the oause of it; but when he learned lhat he was decmed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly beconcealod from those among wham he hod gained this inf ormatian. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and the pretenee of great affection for the brotber arid intcresl in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubroy. Who covld resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recaunt—could speak of hjmself as of an individual baving no sympathy with ariy being on the crowded earth, save with ber to whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had hegun to seem worlhy of prcservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing acoents;—in fine, he knew so well howlo use the serpent'f art, or such wos the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title os the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important cmbaſsy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her hrother's deranged stote,) whicb was to take place the very day before his departure for the coritinent.\nAubre y, when he was left by tbe physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe thc servants, but in vain. He asked for pcn and paper; it was given him; be wrole a letter to hls sister, oonjuring her, as she valved her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of thase now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of tbeir house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on whiob he denounced lhe most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; bvt giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to horclss any more thcmind of Miss Aubrey by, what he c0nsidered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rcst to the busy inmates of thehouse; and Au6rey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than deseribed, tbo notes of busy preparation. M0rning came, ond the sound af carriages broke upon his ear. Auhrey grew almost frontic. The curiosjty of lhe servants at last 0vercame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving hirn in the cuslody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with orie bovnd was 0ut of the room, and in a moment found himself in tbe apartmenl whcre aIl were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was tbe first to perceive him: he immediatoly approached, and, taking his arm hy force, hurried him srom lhe room, speechless wilh rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Reinember your oath, and know, if not rny bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" Sosaying, he pushed blm towards his atlendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in searoh of him. Aubrey cauld no longer support himself; his rage not firiding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not prosent when he entered, as thc physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage wassalemnized, and tbebride and hridegraom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of tbe near approach of death. Hc desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had strvck, he related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardianſ hastened t0 protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrlved, it was too 1ate. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, ond Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACC-\nOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &o.\n\"The world wos all besare him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one af his Majesly'f vessels, in the year 1812, wo put into thc harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this pIaee, and the certaln supply of cattle and vegetableſ always to be hadthere, induce many Britjsh vesfels to visit it—6oth men of war and merchanlmen; and though it lies rather 0ut of the track for ships baund to Smyrna, its bountief amply repay for lhe deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at tbe bottoin of the hay, and whilst the rncn were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with lhe natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave ealled Homer's School, and other placcs, where we had been before. On the brow of Mourit Ido (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with anEnglish lord, wbo left the island four days prcviouſ ta our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wovld have taken me with bim; but I did not ohoose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to got marricd. He was an odd, 6ut a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belangs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gclve Dominick, the winc-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in hif felucca very oflen to the different islands.\"\nThiſ account excited our curi0fity very much, and we lost no timc in hastening to the house where our countryman hadresided. We were kind1y received by cln old man, who eonducted us over the mansion. It cansisted of four apartments on the ground-sloor—an entranee hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parl0ur, anda bed-roam, with a spaciouſ closet arinexed. They were all siinply decorated: plain green-stainod walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the eentre, and a small founlain beneath, which could be madc to play through lhe branches by moving a spring fix ed in the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed tho furn-\niture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an ompty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. Thc bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed through0ut Grecce. In the sitting-room we obferved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then ina large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, bul we did not th ink ourselues juſtified iri cxclmining the eontents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspearo's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's workſ complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerinan, in the German langvage; Klopstock's Messiah; Kolzebue's riovcls; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampblets from the Greek press at ConstontinopIc, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most os these books were filled wjth marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itolian and Latiri. The Messioh wos 1iterally scribbled all ovcr, and marked with sllps of paper, on which also were remorkſ.\nThe old man said:\"The lord had been reading these books tbe evening before he sailed, and forgot to place thcm wjlh the others;but,\" said he, \"there tbey must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one lhing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a fervice; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of il, excopt twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeriian who resides in cl small cottage in the wood, and whorn the lord brougbt here from Adrianople; I dori't know for what reasori.\"\nTho appearance of the house externcllly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces lorig and fourteen hroad, and the fluted marble pillars with bIack p1inths and f ret-w0rk cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were corisiderably higher than lbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, wcls covered by a fine Turkey earpet, berieath an awnirig of strong coarfe linen. Most of the house-tops are thvs furnished, as upon them theGreeks poss their evenings in ſmoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma chrlsti,\" eating fruit, and erijoying the evening breeze.\nOn tbe left hand as we entcrcd the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges arid 1imes wero clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woaden baek was placed, on which we were told, the Iord passed many of his evenings and nights till twe1ve o'clock, reading, writirig, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always ottendedour cburch twice a wcek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A linc of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an aneient Greek lemple appeared in majestic decoy. A small streain issving from tbe ruins des ccnded in broken cafcades, until it was Iost in lhe woods near the m0untain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an harizon vnshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on lhe Ieft, through a vista of lofty cheſnul and palm-trees, several sinall jslands wore distinctly observed, sludding the ljght blue wave wjth spots of emerald green. I se1dorn enjoyod a view more than I did this; but our enqviries were fruilless as ta the name of tbe person who had resided in this romantie solitude: none knew hls name but Damjnick, his bariker, wbo had gone to C andia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you toll, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" Wo had not lime to visit the Armenian,bvt on ovr return to the town we learnt soveral particulars of lhe isolated lord. He had portioncd eight young girls whcn he was last upon the ifland, and even danced with them at tbe nuptial seast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thc girls who livc by weaving these articlef. He also bought a new boat f0r a fisherman who had lost his own in o gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, ho appeared to us, from a1l we collocted, to havc beon cl very occentric and benevolent character. 0ne circumstance we learnt, which our 0ld friend at the cottage thought proper nol to diselose. He had o most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on tbe sea-shore, and he had boughl her a piano-forte, and taught her himsclf the use of it.\nSucb was the inforination with which wo departed from the peacefvl isle of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on lhe rack, guessing who this ramblerin G reece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of dispositian, arid alI those eccentricities which mark peculjar gonius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Fall ing in campany with Mr. FOSTER, the arehitect, a pvpil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeco, \"Tbe individual,\" said he, \"about wh0m you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had ne ver thenheard 0f his lordship's fame, as we had boen some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of CaleIa in e very page. Deeply did wc regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cotlage, but we consoled ourselves with the ldea os returning to Mitylene ori some future day; but to me that day will riever return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has beeri grossly slandered. He has been described as os an unfeelirig disposition, averse to afsociating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is direclly the reverse, as may be ploinly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the firier seelings of lhe hearl, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's pooms, seem to have their seat jn his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and cbarity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solilude if an additional reas0n for marklng him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over wh0se head Benev0lence hath thrown ber mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his 1oves orpleafures, I do not assume a right to give an opiriion. Reports are ever to be received wilh caution, porticularly when directed against man's m0ral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before tbat awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is w0rlhy of his genius. To do good ln secret, clnd shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-eourt, Fleet-stroet.",
    "clean": "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy.

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tclle is founded is very general in the East. Am0rig thc Arabians it appears to he common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after thc establlshment of Christianity; and it has only asſumed jts present form since the division of the Latin and Greck ohurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latln body could not corrupl if huried in their territory, it gradually jncreased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from tbeir graves, and feeding upon the blood of tbe young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that uampyres nightly im6ibed a certain portion of the bload of thcir victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, ond specdlly died of consumptions; whilst these bvman bload-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended ta such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow frorn all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very poref of their skins.\nIn the Londori Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account af a particular oase of vampyrism, which is stated to hclve oecurred atModreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an oxaminotion of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the pIace, they positively andunanimously afsirmed, tbat, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of thc Turkish Servia, he had bcen tormented by a vampyre, hut had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eatirig some of lhe earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing bimsels with hls blood. This precoution, however, did not prevent him from becoming cl vampyre himſelf;for, abovt twenty or thirty days afler his deatb and burial, mony personſcomplained of having been tormented by him, and a depositjon was made, that four persons had heen deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mjschicf, the inhabilants having cansuIted their Hadagni, took up the b ody, and found it (as is supposed ta be usuaI in casef of vampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free fr0m corruption, and emitting clt the mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid bIood. Proof baving been thus obtained, they resorted lo the clccuftomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body 0f Arnold Paul, at which be js reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same mcasures were adapled with the corsef 0f those pcrsoris who had preui0usly died srom vampyrism, lest they should, in thejr turn, beeome agentf upon others who survived them.\nThe universal beliof is, that a person fucked hy a vampyre becomes a va mpyre himself, and svcks in hif turn.\nChief hcliliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, hecause it feems bctter adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many pclrts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infemal visitations solely to those beings hc loved most while upon earth—those lo wbom he was bound by ties 0f kindred and affectlon.—A supposition alIuded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vompyre sent,Tby corse shall from lts tamb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck lhe blood of all thy raee; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loalbc the banquel which perforce Muft feed thy livid llvjng corse, Thy uictims, ere they yet expire, Sball know the demon for their sire;As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy fIowers aro withered on the stem. But orie that for thy crime must fall, The youngeft, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee wilh a father's name— That word fhall wrap thy bcart in flamo! Yet thou must end thy task arid mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must viewWhich freezes o'er ils lifeless blue; Then wilb unhal1owod hand shall tear Thc tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in lifea lock when shorn Affectlon's fo ndest pledgewas worn— But now is 6orne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From fpectre more accursed than tbey.\nMr. Southey has also iritroducod in his wlld but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returnod fr0m the grave for the purpose of tormentjnghirn she best loved whilst in existencc. But this cannot be ſupposed to have re sulted from tbe sinfulness of her life, she 6eing povrtrayed tbrougbout the whole os the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to whieh he pretonds to have been cln eyewitness; and Calmct, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of clneodotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative os its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; thovgh the present may suff-\nice for the limits of a riote, necessorily deuoted to explanati0n, and which may now be concluded by merely remarkin g, thot though the term Vampyre js the one iri most general acceptatlon, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of tho world: as Vrau colocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in thc midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, lhere appearedat tbe various parties of the leaders 0f the tori a nobleman, more remarkabIe for his singularltieſ, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, aſ if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fclir only attracted his atlentiori, that hemight by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasls where thougbtIesſness reigned. Thofe who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence jt aroſe: someatlributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the objoct's face, did not seem to penetrote, and at one glaneeto pierce throvgh to the iriword worklngs of the heclrt; but feIl upon the cbcek with cl leaden ray tbat weighed upan the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be iriv ited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who hod been clccustomod to violent excitemcnt, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having somcthing in their presence oapable os engaging their attention. In spite of the deodly hue af his foee, which never gained a warmer tint, eitber frorn the blush of modesty, or from thc strong emotion of passion, th0ugh its farm and outline wcre beautiful, mariy of the female hunters afternotoriety attemptod to win his attentions, and gain, at leost, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Merc er, wbo had been the mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms slnee her marrjage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress os a mountebank, to attract his notice:—thougb in vain:—when she stood before him, thaugh his eyes were apparently fixed upori ber's, still il soemed as if they were unperceived;—evcn her unappalled iinpudence was baffled, and she left the field. But thougb the common adultress could not influence ovon the guidclnce of his eyes, it was not that the feinale sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparenl cavtion with which he spoke to the virtuous wife arid innocent doughter, that few knew he ever addressed himsclf tofemales. He had, however, tbe reputation af a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was cls often arnong those females who form thc boast of lheir sex from thcir d0mestic virtues, as among thofe who ſully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there carne to London a young gentleman of the nclme of Aubrey: be waſ an orpban left with an only sister in the possession of greclt weallh, by parents who died while he was yet jn childbood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thoughl it their duly merely lo take care os his fortune, while they reIinquisbed the more important charge of his mirid to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivaled more his imaginatjon than hiſ iudgmenl. He had, hencc, that high ramantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruinf so many mi1liners' apprentices. He belicved all to sympathjse with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the rnifery of a cottage merely consisted in tho vesting of elothes, which wore as warm, but which were hetter adaptedto tbe painter's eye by their irregu1ar folds and vorl0us coloured patcbes. He thought, jn fine, that the dreams of poels were the realilies of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into thc gay circles, manymotbers surroundcd him, slriving which sho uld dcscribe with least truth their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening counlenonees when he approachcd, and by their sparkling eyes, when ho opened his lips, soon 1ed him into false nolions of his talents and hiſ merjt. Attached as he was lothe romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow clnd wax candles thal flickered, not from the prosence of a gbost,but srom want of snuffing, tbere waſ no foundation jri real lise for ariy of that congeries of pleclsing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from whioh he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compenſation jn bis gratisied vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when thc extraordinary 6eing we haue above described, crosfed him in hjs career.\nHe walchod bim; and the very impossibilily of forming an idca os the character of a man entirely abs0rbed in hiinself, who gave few other signs of his observation of exterrial objects, lhcln the tacit assent to lheir existence, implied by the avoidance of tbeir contact: allowing his jmagination to picture every thing that flattercd its prapensity to extravagant ideas, hesoon formed this objoct into tbe hero of a r0mclnce, and determined to obsorve the offspring of hif fancy, rather than lhe person before him. He hecame acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rvthven's afsairs were embarrclssed, and soon fovnd, srom the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was clboul lo traveI. Desirous of gaining fome informotion respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to persorm lhe lour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to eriable the young to take some rapid steps in the caroer of vice towards pulting themselves upon an equality with the agod, and not a1lowing them to appcar as if fa1len froin the skies, whenover seandal0us intrigues clre mentioned as lhe subiects of pleasanlry or of praise, according to the degree of skill sbewn iri corrying them on. They consentod: clnd Aubrey immediateIy mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to recelve from him a proposal to j0in him. Flattered by suoh a mark af esteem from hiin, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circ1ing waters.\nHitberto, Aubrey had had no opporturiity of studying Lord Ruthven's charactor, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed t0 his view, the results offercd diffcrent conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse jn hls liberality;—the idle, lhe vaga6ond, and the boggar, reoeived from his hand more tharienovgh to relieve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could not auoid remarking, thatit was not vpon tbe virtuous, redueed to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upori virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent frorn the doorwith hardly suppressed sneers; but when theprofligate oame to ask fometbing, not to relieue his wants, but to allow himt0 wall0w in hiſ lust, or to sinkhim still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, howeuer, attributed by him to the greater importunity os tbe vicious,which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of thc virtuous indjgent. There was one ciroumstance about tho charity of his Lordship, which was ftill more impresfed upon his mind: all those upon whom il was be stowed, inevitably found that t here was a curse upon jt, sor they were all either led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lawest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Avbrey was surprized at the apparent eagemess with which bis companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there be entered into all the spjrit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonlst, ond then he lost even more than he goined; but it was always with lhe same unohanging face, with which he generally watched the society arourid: it was not, howevor, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless sather of a numerous family; then his very wifh seemed fortune's law—this apparentobstroctedness of mind waslaid aside, ond hiſ eyes sparkled with more sire thon that of the cot whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In overy t own, he left the former1y affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursirig, in tbe solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of tbis siend; whilsl many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, witb0ut o single farthing of his late immense wealth, whcrcwith t0 buy even sufficient lo satisfy their prescnt craving. Yet he toak no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of mclny, the last gi1der he had just snatched frorn lhe convulsive graspof the innocent: thls might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, howevor, capable of c0m6ati ng the cvnriing of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to reprefont lhis to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profi-\nt;—but he delayed it—for each day ho hoped his friend would giue him some opportunity of speakirig frankly arid 0penly to him; however, this n ever occurred. Lord Ruthven in his earriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scencs af riature, wcls always the same: his eye spoke less than his llp; and thougb Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained n0 greater gratjfication from it than the constant excitement of vainly wisbing to break that mystery, which to his exalted irnagination began to assume the appearance of something fuperncltural.\nTbey soon arrived ot Romc, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight ofhis companion; he left bim in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an ItaIian countess, whilst he went ln search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he waf thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which be apened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; lhe others were frorn his guardianf,the latter astonished him; if it had before entercd into his imagination thal there was an evil power reslderit iri his companion, these seemed to give him ſufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upan his iminedlately leaving his friend, and urged, lhat his character wcls dreadfully vicjovs, for thot the possession os irresistible powers os seduction, render ed his licentious habits more dangerous to socicty. It had been dlscovered, thal his contempt for the adultress hod not orjginated in hatred of her cbaracter; but that he had required, t0 enhance his gratification, that hiſ victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vnsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss 0f infamy and degradation: in fine, that all th ose females wbom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, throwri even the mask aside, and had not scrup1ed to expose the whoIe deformity of tbeirvices to the public gazc.\nAubrey determined up0n leaving orie, whose eharaeter had not yet shown a single bright point on whicb to reft the oye. He resolved to inverit some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, pvrposing, in the mean while, to walch him more closely, and to let no flight circumstclnces pass by unnoticed. Hc entored int0 tbe samc circlo, and soon perceivcd, that bis Lordſhip was endeavouring to wark up0n the inexperierice of the daughler of the lady wbose hause hc cbiefly frequenled. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmclrried female is met with in society; he was therefore obligod to carry on hls plans in secret; but Avbrey's eye fol1owcd him in all his windings, arid s0on discovcred that an assignation bad been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though tboughtlesſ girl. Losing no time, he entered tbe apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly osked bim his intentions with refpect to tho lady, insorming him at thc same timc tbat he was awore of his beirig clbout to meet her thclt very nlght. Lord Ruthven answered, that hls intentions were such as he supposed all wovld have upon svch an occasion; and upon being pressed whcther he inlended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediotely writing a note, lo say, that from that moment he must dooline accompanying bis Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant ta seek othcr opartments, arid calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her ofa1l he kncw, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character os his Lordship. Theassignation was prevented. Lord Rutbven next day merely senl his fervant to nolify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of bis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's inlerposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubroy directed his slcps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himse1f at Athens. He tben fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded rec0rds of clnoient gIory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of cbranicling the deeds of freemen only besore slaves, had hidden theinselves herieath the sheltering soil or mony coloured lichon. Under the sarne roof as himſelf, existed a being, so beauliful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a pairiter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the falthful ln Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyef spoke loo much mind for any one to think she could bclong to thoso who hod no souls. As she danced upori the plaln, or tripped along the movntclin's side, one w0uld have tbought the gazelle a poor type of her beavties; for whowould have exchanged her eye, app-\narently the eye of onimated nature, for that sleepy luxuriovs lookof tbe animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe oflen accompanied Avbrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girI, erigaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, show lhe whole beauty of her form, flaating as it were vpon the wlnd, to the eager gazo of him, wbo forgot the Ictters he had juft decyphered upon an almoft efsaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-liko figure. Ofteri would her tresses folling, cls ſho flitted around, exhibit in the sun's roy such delicatcly brilliarit and swif-\ntly fading huef, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of tbe antiqvary, who let escape from his mind the very obiect he had before thought of vilal importance to the proper interpretatian of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none cari appreciato?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stlflirig balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, shc wovld stand by, and watch the maglc effects of his pencil, in tracing lhe scenes of her native plaee; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the operi pIain, would pclint, to him in all lhe glowing colourſ of youthfu1 memory, the marriage pomp she remembered uiewing ln her insancy; ond then, turning lo subjects tbat had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talos of her nurse. Her eamestriess and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest euen of Aubrey; and 0ften as shc told him thc tale of the living vampyre, who had pafsed years amidst his friends, and dearestties, forced every year,by feeding upon the life os a lovely female to prolong his existenee for the ensujng months,his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted lo lclugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; bul Iantho cited to him the names of old men, who had ot last detected one living among themselves, after severol of their near relatives and childron had been found marked with the stamp of tho fiend's appetite; and when she found him ſo inoredulous, she bcgged of bim to helieve her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged tbem, witb grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him tbe tradilianaI appearance of these monslers, ond his horror waſ incrcased, by hearing a pretty aceurate description of L0rd Ruthven; he, however, sti1l persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, thougb at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supcrnatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began t0 ottacb himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so cantrasted with all the affected virtuesaf the womon among whom he had sought for bis vision of romance, won his heart; clnd while he ridicvled the idea of a young man of English habits, marryingan uneducated Greek girl, stjll hc found himsolf more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forrnjng a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determiried not to return until his o6ject was cltlained; but he always found it impossible to fixhis attentlon upon tbe ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image thal seemed al0ne the rjghtsvl possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantilo being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with re1uctance; but it was because she had no longer any one wilh whorn she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncavering some fragmerit whicb had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the su6ject of Vampyros, and they both, with several present, affirmed their exlstence, pale with horror at the very nclme. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one os his excursions, whioh was to detain him sor a few hours; when thcy heardthe name of the place, they all at once begged of him not lo return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greekwould ever remain, after tbe day had closed, upon any consideratian. They described it as the resort os the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the mosl heavy evils as impending upori him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and lried to laugh them out of the idea; hut when he ſaw them shudder at his da ring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, thc very name of which apparently made their bl0od freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; ho wcls surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that hif wordſ, mooking the belief 0f those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of bis horse, and earnestly begged ofhim to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings t0 be put iri action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupjed in his researoh, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horjzon there was one of those specks which, in tho warmcr climates, s0 rapidly gather into a lremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted covntry.—He at laft, however, mounted his horse, determined lo make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twi1ight, in theso southern climates, is olmost unknowri; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and erc he had advanced far, lhe power of the storm was above—its ecboing thunders had scarcely an inlerval of rest—its thick heavy rajn forced ils way through the cariopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly hiſ horse took frjght, and he was earried with dreodfulrapidity through the entangled forest. The animcll at last, through fati gue, stopped, and he found, by tbe glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel thclt hardly lifted itself up fr0m thc masses of dead loaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting lo obtain sheIter from the pelting of the storm. As he approachcd, tbe thunders, for cl moment silent, allowed hlm to hearthe dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a 1augh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled aver his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, tb0ugh he oalled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Agairi baff1od!\" to which a lovd laugh succeeded; and he selt himself grappled by one whose strengtb seemed svperhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, ho struggled; but it waſ in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—hisenemy threw himſelf upon him, and kneeIing upon his breast, had placed his hands up0n his throat—when the glare of many torches perietrating through tbe hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him;—he instantly roso, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the daor, and in a moment the craſhing os the branches, as he broke through the wood, was rio l0nger heard. The ſtorm was now still; and Aubrey, incclpable of movirig, waf soon heard by those wjthout. They entered; tbe light of thcjr torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At lhe desire of Avbrey tbey seclrched for hcr who had ottracted him by her cries; he was agaln left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light 0f the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of hjs fair conductrefs brought in o lifeless corse.He shut his eyes, hoping thal it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; bul he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour vpon her oheek, not even upon hcr lip; yet there was a stillness obout her face that seomed almost cls attaching as the life lhat 0nce dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was bIood, ond vpon her throat were the mclrks of teeth having opened the vein:—to lhis the men pointed, crying, simvltaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was qvickIyformed, and Aubrey was 1aid by tbe side of ber who had lately been tahim the object of somany bright and fairy visi0nf, now fallen with the flawer af life that had died within her. Heknew not wbal his thoughts were—his mlnd was benumbed and seemed to shun reslectiori, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost uneonsciovsly in his hand a naked dagger of a parljcular construction, which had been found in the hut. They weresoon met by different parties who had boen engaged ln the search of her whom a motber had missed. Their lamentabIe cries, as they approached the cjty, forewarned thc parents of some dreadful cataflrophe. —Todescribe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the ccluse af their obild's death, they 1ooked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were incons0lable; both died broken-heartcd.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often deIirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combinalion he feemed to beg os his formcr coinpanion to spare the being be l0ved. Al other times he would iinprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him cls her deslroyer. L0rd Ruthucn, chanced at tbis time lo arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing os the state of Avbrey, iminediate1y placed himſelf in the same house, and became his constant attendant. Whcn the latter reeovered from his delirium, he was borrified clnd stortlod at the sjght of him whosc image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hjs kind words, implying almostrepentance for the fault that had caused their separatjon, and still more by the attenti0n, anxiety, and carc which hc showed, soon reconciled him to hls preseriee. His lordshlp seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic bcing who had so astonishcd Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence begon to be rapid, he again gradually retlred into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perc-\neived no difference from the former man, except that at timos he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a srni1e of rnalicious exultati0n playing vpon his lips: he knew not why, but thjs smile haunted him. Durjng the last stage of the invalid's rocovery, Lord Ruthven was appareritly engaged in watching the tidelesſ waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of tbose orhſ, circling, like our world, the moueless sun;—indeed, be appeared to wisbto av0id the eyef of all.\nAu6rey's mjnd, by this shock, was muoh weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whicb had once so distingvished hlm now scemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence aſ Lord Ruthven; but mvch as he wished for solitudc, hls mind covld not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if hc sought itamidst the ruinf he had formerly frequented, Iantbe's form stood by his side—if he sought it iri the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly tvrning round, would fhow, to his wild imaginatjon, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her 1ips. He determined to fly soerieſ, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender core he had taken of hlm during his illness, that they should visit those ports af Greece nejther had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, arid sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hasteried from placeto place,yet they scemed not to heed what thcy gazed upon. They heard muchof robberſ, but they gradually began to sligbt these reports, wbich thcy imaginodwere only the inventjon of iridividuals, wbose interest it was to excite the generosity of thoſe wh0m they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting tbe advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serveas guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a riarrow defile, at tho bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down srom the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whoIe os tho party engaged ln the riarrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close ta their beads, and by theechoed report of several guns. In an instant their gvards had left them, and, placing themselves bohirid rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the rep0rt came. Lord Rvthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a momerit 6ehjnd the sheltering turn of tbe defile: but ashamed ofbeing thus detained by a foe, who with insultirig shouts bode thcm advance, and beirig exposed t0 unreſisting slaughter, if any of tho robbers should climb above and lako them in the rear, they detcrmined at once to rush forward iri search of the enemy. Hardly had they 1ost the shelter of the rock, whcn Lord Rulhven received a ſhot in the sh0ulder, which br0ught him to theground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hoeding the conteſt or his own peril, was soan surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immcdiately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promisef of great reward, Aubrey soon induced tbem to convey his wounded frierid to a neighbouring cabin; and hauing agreed upon a ransom, he was rio more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely ta guard the entrance till their comrade shouId return with the promised sum, for which he hcld an order. Lord Ruthveri's strength rapidlydecreased; in two days mortification ensued, and dcath seemed advoncing with hasty stepſ. His conduct and appearance had not chonged; he seemed as urieoriscious of pain as he had been of the obje cts aboul him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind become apparently uneasy, and bis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his a ssistance with more thori usuol earnestness—\"Assiſt me! you may saue me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed lbe declth of my existence as little as lhat of the poſsing day; but you inay sclve my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me h0w? I would do any lhing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I canriot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all yov know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shclll not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying inan, raising hlmself with exultant violence, \"Sweclr by clll yaur soul reueres, by all your riature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any liuing being in any way, whatever may hoppen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyef seomed bvrsting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" fajd Aubrey; he sunk loughing upon his pjllow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his ocquaintancc with this man rofe upon his mlnd, and he knewnot why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if sromlhe presentiment of s0mething horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the moming, he was about to enter tbe hovel in which ho had left the eorpse, when a robber met him,and informed him lhat lt was no loriger there, havirig been canveyed by himſelf and comrades, upon hls retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according lo a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that roſe after his death. Aubrcy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, whenhe had mounted to the summit he found no lrace of eitber the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed ovt the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a tlme his rnirid was b ewlldered ln corijectures, bul he at last returned, convinced that they had buried tbe corpſe for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary ofa country in wbich he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his inind, he resalved to leave it, and soon orrived at Smyrna. While waitirig for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Nap1os, he oecupied himself in arranging those effects he had with bim belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other tbings there was a case containing sev-\neral weaporis of offence, more or less adapted to ensvre the death of the victim. There were several daggers ond ataghans. Whilst tuming them over, and examinirig their curious sarms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented iri the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hasteriing to gain further proof, he f ound lhe weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, thougb peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His oyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left n0 room for doubt; there were also drops of 6lood on each.\nHe left Smyrncl, and on his way home, at Rome, hif first inquiries were concerning the lady he had cltteinpted to sriatchfrom Lord Ruthven's seductiue arts. Her parents were in distress, their forturie ruinod, and she had not beeri heard of since the deparlurc of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almosl braken under so many repeoted horrors; he was clfraid that this 1ady had fallen a victirn to thc destrayer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed af the postilions, as if he were going to save tbe life of some one he held dear. Ho orrived al Ccllais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wlll, so0n wafted hlm to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri thc embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infariljne caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she wcls stiIl more attaching as a companlon.\nMiss Aubrey had riot that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. Tbere was none of that lighl brilliancy which only exists in the beatod atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her b1ue eye was never lit vp by thc levity of the mind benealb. There was a inelancholy charin clbout it which did riot seem to arise from mlssortune, but from some feeIing within, lhat appeored to indicate a soul conscious of a brigbter realm. Her ftep was not that light foollng, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may atlract—it waf sedate and pensive. Wben alone, her face was never brlghtened by the smile of joy; but whcn her brother breathed lo her his affection, and wovld in hor prcsence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemod as if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own notive spbere. She wos yel only eighteen, and had not beon presented to the world, il having heen thought by her guclrdians more fit that her presentation should be delayed untll her brother's return from the cont-\ninenl, when he mlght be her protector. It was now, thercfore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, sh0u1d be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansian of bls fathors, and fed upon the melancholy which averpowered him. He could not feel intereſt clboul the frjvolities of fashianable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the euentf he had witnessed; but he determincd to sacrificc his own comfort to the proteclion of his sisler. Thcy soon arrived in tawn, and prepared for lhc next day, which had been announced as a drowing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-raom had not been held for a long tlme, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of roycllty, haste ned thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he waf stclnding jn a cornor by himself, heedlesf of all around him, engoged in the remembrance thal the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himsels suddenly scized by the arm, and a vojce be recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre thclt would blast hirn, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure whicb had attracted his riotice on this spotupon his first entry into society. He gazed till his Iimbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obligod to take the arm of a frierid, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he lhrow himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Rvthven again before him—circumstances ftorted up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oatb.—He roused himself, he could not beIieve it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upori. It wcls impossible tbat it could bc real—he deterinined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to clsk concorning Lord Rutbven, the name hung upon bis lips, and he could nat succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after wilh his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himfelf up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, al last, that mony were leaving, he roused himsels, and entering another room, fovnd his sister surroundedby several, apparently in carnest coriversatiori; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned raund, and reveaIed to bim lhose features he moſt a6horred. He sprang forward,sejzed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he fourid himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waitirig for their lords; ond while he was engaged in passing them, he ogain heard lhat voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, bvt, h vrrying his sister, soon reochedhorne.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had bcen absorbed by one subiect, how mueh more complelely was it engrossed, now tbat thc certainty of the monster's living againpressed upon hjf lhoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, arid it was in vain thal she intreated him to ex ploin to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few w0rds, and thoso terrified her. The more he thought, the mare he was bewildered. Hisoath startled bim;—was he then to allow this morister to roarn, bea ring ruin up0n his breath, amidst all be beld doar, and not avert its progress? His very sistcr mlght have been tovched by him. But even if he were to break his oalh, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe bim? He thought 0f ernploying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but deatb, hc remembered, bad beori already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he sow no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At lasl, n0 longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street lo street, anxious to fly tbat image which haunted him. Hjf dress becaino neglecled, arid ho wondered, as often expoſed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight damps. He wos no longer t0 be recognized; al first he returned witb the evening to tbe house; but at last he laid him down to reſt wherever fatigue overto0k him. Hif sister, anxious for bis sclsety, emp1oyed people to follaw him; but lhey were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuerswifter than any—srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly chariged. Stru ok wltb tho jdea that he left by his ahsence the wholo of his frionds, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconfcious, he determined to enter again inlo society, and watch him closely, anxious to sorewarn, in spite of his oath, all whorn Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered irit0 a room, hjs baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, thal his sister wcls at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, sor her sakc, a society which affccted hiin so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavojIing, lhe guardians thovght proper to interpose, and, foaring that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which hod been before imposod upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiroufof saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him fr0m exposing to the gcneral eye those inarks of what they consldered folly, theyengaged a physicianto reside in the house, arid take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so oompletely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His inc0herence became at laft so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wovld often lie for days, inoapahle of being roufed. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—tbe only sign of affoctlon and recollection remaining displayed itself upon lhe entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks thot ſeverely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not louch bim—if your love for me is aught, d0 not go near him!\" When, however, sho inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\"and again he sank into a state, whcncc not cven sbe c0uld rouse him. This lasted mclny months: gradually, bowever, asthe year was passing, his incoherences became less freqvenl, and his mind threw offa porlion of its gloom, whilst hjs guardianſ observed, that severaI times in the day hc would count upon his fjngers a definite num6er, and then smile.\nTbe time hcld nearly elapsed, when, upon lhe last day of the year, one of his gvardians entering his room, began lo converse with his physician upon the melancholy circuinstance of Auhrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his slster was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's alterition was attrclcted; he asked anxiously ta whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of wbich they feared he hadbeen deprived, tbey mentioned the nameof the Earl os Marsden. Thinking this was a yaung Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astanished them still more by his expressing his jntention tobe present at lhe nuptials, and desiring to see his sjstor. They answered not, but in a few minutef his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influenco of her lovely sinile; for hc pressedher to his breast, arid kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more aliue to the feelings of affection. He 6egan to speak with all his wontod warmth, and ta oongratulato hcr upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived o locket upon her breasl; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who hcld so long inslueneed his life. He seized lhe portrait in a paroxysrn of rage, arid trampled iturider foot. Upon hcr asking him why he thus destroyed the resemhlance of her future hus6and, he looked as if he did not understand ber—then seizing her hands, and gazing on ber with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But hccould not advclnce—it seemed af if that voice clgairi bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord R uthven was near him but faw no one. Iri the meantime the guardians and physiclan, who had hcard the whole, and thought this was but a relurn of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her ta leave him. He fell upon bis knees to them, he implored, be hegged of them to delay but for one doy. They, attributing thjs to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured lo pacisy him, and retired.\nLord Rutbuen had ealled the morning after tho drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Au6rey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of jt; bul when he loarned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened ta the bouse of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenoe of great affection for the brother arid interest in his fate, hc gradually won tho ear of Miss Aubrey. Who c ould resist his power? His tongue had dangers arid tolls to rccount—could speak of himself as of an lndividual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save wjth her to whoin he addressed himself;—cou1d tell how, sinco he knew her, his existenoe, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to hor soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use lhe serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affeotions. The titleof the elder branoh falling at Iength to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuſe for hastening the marriage, (ln spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take placethe very day bef0re his departure for tho continerit.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servanls, bul in valn. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happineſs, her own honour, and the honour of tbose now iri the grave, who once held her jri their arms as their hope and the hope of their hause, to delay but for a few bours that marriage, on which he denaunced thc most heavy curses. The servants promised thoy would deliver jt; but gjvirig it to the physician, he th0ught it better not to harass any morethe mjnd of Miss Aubrey by, wbat he considered, tbe ravirigs of a maniac. Night pclssed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a h0rror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy prcparation. Morning come, and the sound of carriages broke upon his eclr. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of thc servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually sto1e away, leaving himlri the custody of an helpless a1d woman. He seized the opp0rtunity, wlth one bound was out of the room, and in a moment faund himself in the apartment where all were nea rly assembled. Lord Ruthvon was the first t0 perceive him: he immedialely approacbed, and, takirig bis arm by force, hurried bim from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remeinber your oath, arid kriow, if not my bridc to day, your sisler if dishonoured. Women aro frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his ottendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Auhrey couldno longer support bimself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vesse1, and he was conveyed to bed. This waf not mentioned to bis sister, who was riot present when heentered, asthe physician was afraid of agitating her. Tbe mclrriage was solemnized, and tho bride and bridegroom loft London.\nAvbrey's weaknoss increaſed; the effu-\nsion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be oalled, and when the midnight bovr had struck, be related composcdly what the reader has pcrused—he djed immediately after.\nThc guardians hastoned to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had dlsappeared, and Av6rey's sisler had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, C0NTAINING AN ACCOUNT 0F LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LDRD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, wherc to choose his placo of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through tbe Grecian ArchipcIago, onboard one of his Majesty's vessels, in thc year 1812, we put into tho harbour of Mitylene, in the lsland of that namc. The beauty of this place, and lhe certain supply of catlle and vegetableſ always to be had there, induce many Brilish vosfels to visit it—both men of war and merchontmen; and thougb it lies rather out of the tra ck for ships bound to Smyrria, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom af the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargairiing for oatt1e with the natives, the clergyman and rnyself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Schoal, and other places, wherewe had been bcfore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so riamed) we met with and cngaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who loft tho island four dayf prevlous to our arrival in his fe1ucca. \"Heengaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He wos an odd, hut a very good man. The cotta ge over the hill, fclcing the river, belongs to him, and he has lcft an old man in charge of jt: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hvndred zechines sor it, (obout L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen monlhs, though not constantly; for he fails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excjted our curiosity vory much, and we loft n0 time in hastening to the house where our counlryman hcld resided. We were kindly receivod 6y an old man, who coriducted us over thc marision. It c0nsisted of sour apartments on tbe ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spaciaus closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walIs, marble tclbles on either side, a large myrtlo iri the centre, and a sm all fountairi beneath, which could be made to play through lhe brancheſ by moving a spring fixed iri the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In tbe hall stood hals a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-casc: there were no mirrorf, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed ootton quilts and a pillow—lhe common bed throughout Greoce. In the sitting-room wo o6served a marble recess, formerly, the old man told uf, fil1ed with books and pclpers, whicb were then jn a large scaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did nat think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tabIet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complcte; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmorman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebve's novels; Schiller's play of the Robberf; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Pclrma in1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Canstantinople, much torri, but rio English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with margi nal notes, written with a pencil, iri Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips os paper, on which also wore remarks.\nThe o1d man faid: \"Tbe lord bad been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to p1ace them witb the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, thal were I to move one thing withovt orders, he would frown upon me sor a week together; he iſ othcrways verygood. I once did him a ser vice; and I bave the produce of this farm for the trouble 0f taking care ofit, except twcnty zechines which I pay to an clged Armeniari who resides in a small cottage jn the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe oppearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. Tbe portico ln front was fifty pclces long arid fourteen broad, and the f1uled marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornlces, (as it is now customary in Greeian arcbitecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded hy a light stone balustrade, was covered by a sine Turkey carpet, benoath cln awning of strong coarse lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon thern the Greeks pass their evenirigs in smoking, dririking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we enterod the hause, a small ſlreamlet glided away, grapes, orclnges clnd limes wcre clustcring together an its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with ari ornamental wooden back was p1aced, on whicb we were told, the lord passcd many of his euenings and nights till lwelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"prclying\" for he waf very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat wcls what may be termed \"a bjrd's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CalcIa, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek templc appeared jri majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the rujns dcscended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountairi's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed bya single cloud, terminales the view in frorit; and alittle on the left, tbrough avista af losty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name os the person who had residod in this romantic solitude: none knew his name hut Domjnick, hls banker, wbo hcld gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, bul I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" We had not time l0 uisit the Armenlan, but on our return to the town we learrit seueral particuIars of the isolated lord. He had portion ed eight young girls when he waf laft upon the island, and even danced with thom at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton ond silk to the girls who live by weaving lhese articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishorman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to thepoor children. In short, be appcared to us, from all we collected, to have beeri a very eccentrjc and beneuolent c haracter. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper nat to disclose. He had a mosl beautisul daughter, with whom the lord was ofteri seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself tbo use of it.\nSuch was the information wjth whjch we departed from the peaceful is1e of Mitylone; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who tbis rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was euident: he had philanthropy of disposilion, and aIl those eccentricities whicb mark peculiargcnius. Arrived at Palermo, all ovr douhts wcre dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil os WYATT'S, who had boen travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The indjvidual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visitcd hiin at MityIene.\" We had never then heard 0f his lordship's fame, as we had been some yeclrs from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into 0ur bclnds we recognized the recluse of Calcla jn every page.Deeply did we regret not having beon more curious in our refearches at the cottage, but we consolcd ourselves wlth the idea 0f returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to methat day will rievcr return. I make this statemerit, believing it not quite uninteresting, arid in justice lo his l0rdship's good name, which bas been grossly slondered.He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to afsociating with hvman nature, or contributing in any woy to sooth its sorraws, or add to ils pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gclthered from thesc Iittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depictcd in his lordship'f poems, seem to hove thcir seat in his hosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guidc clll his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is on addition a1 reoson for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolenee hatb thrown her mantle. No rnari can read lbe precedingpleasing \"traits\" witbout feeljng proud of him aſ a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleclfures, I do not assume a right to givc an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with cauti0n, particularly when directed agoinst man's moral integrity; and he wbo dares justify himself before lhat awsu1 tribuncll where a1l must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron'scharacter is worthy of his gcnius. To do good in secret, and ſhun the world's applause, is the surest lestimany of a virtuous heart and self-clpprovirig conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-c0urt, Fleet-street.",

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this talo js founded is very general in thc East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, h0wever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its preſent form since the divjsion of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thal a Latin body c0uld not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually iricreafed, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the deod rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beoutiful. In the Wesl it spreod, with some slight variation, all ovor Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrairie, where the belicf existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed cl eertain portion 0f the blood of their victims, wbo bocame emaciated, lost their strength, andspeedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and tbeir veins became distended to such a stale af replelion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the paſsages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skinſ.\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, os courso, credible aec0unt os a parlicular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, iri Hungary. Il appears, thol upon an examincltion of the commander-in-ohief and magistratef of theplace, lhey positively and unariimously afsirmed, that, about five years before, acertain H eyduke, named Arn0ld Paul, had beeri heard t0 say, that, at Cassovia, on lhe frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormerited by cl vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himself of the evil, by eclting s0me of thc oarth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing hjmself with his blood. This precaution, howevor, didnot prevent him from 6ecoming a vampyre himself; for, aboul twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons cornpIained of having been tormented by him, anda deposition was made, that four perſons had beeri deprived 0f life by his attacks. To preuent further mischjef, tbe inhabltants having consulted their Hadagni, took up tho body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual iri cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free frorn corrvption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure and florid 6lood. Proof havirig been thus obtoined, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reporled to bave cried out as dreadfu1ly as if he bad 6een alive. This done, they cvt ofs hls head, burned his body, andthrew the afhes into his grave. The same measures were cldopted with thecorses of those persons who had prcuiously died froin vampyrism, lest they fhould, in their turn, 6 ocome clgents upon others who survived them.\nTbe unluersaI belief is, that a person sucked by a uampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChjef bailiff.\nThismonstrous r0domontade is hore related, hecause lt seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the presenl ob servations lhan any olher instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is eonsidered as a sort os punishment after dcath, for some heinovscrime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compe1led to canfine his infcrnal visilcltions solcly to those beings be loved m0st while upon eorth—those to whoin he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition cllluded lo in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall froin its tomb be rent; Theri ghastly haunt the native place, And suck tho blood of all thy rclce; There from tby daugbter, sister, wife, Al midnight drain the stream of Iife; Yet loathe the ban quct which perforce Must feed thy livjd liuing corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers aro withered on the stom. But one that for lhy crime must fall, The youngest, best belovedof all, ShaIl bIesf thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap lhy heart in flame! Yet thou must ond thy lask arid mark Her cheek's last tingc—hcr eye's lasl spark, And the last glaſsy glance must view Which freezes o'er ils lifoless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shalltcar The tresseſ of her yellow hair, Of which, ln life a lock wheri shom Affeetian's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine ago ny! Yet with thirie own best blood shall dr ip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard ljp; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Govls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre rnore accursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey has also lntroduced in his wild but beclutiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the uampyre corse of the Arabian maid 0neiza, who is represented as hav ing returned from the grave sor the purpose of tormenting hlm she best loved whilst in existcnce. But this cannot 6e supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her llfc, she bcing pourtrayed throughout the whole of lhe tale as o complete type of purity arid innocence. The veraciovs Tournefort gives a long accourit in his trclvelf of several astonishing cclses of vampyrism, to wbich he pretcrids to have been an eycwitnefs; and Calmet, iri his great work upon lhis subjoct, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditi0nary narratives illustrative of ils efsects, has pvt forth some learned dissertations, lendirig to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting n0ticef on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the presenl may suffice for the limits 0f a note, necessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be eoncluded by merely remarkjng, that though the term Vampyre is the 0ne in most general acceptatiori, lhere are several others synonymous with it, made use of in variousparts of the world:as Vrouoolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHEVAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations ottendant upon a London winter, thcre appeared at the various parties of tbe leaders of the ton a noblemon, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth aro und him, as if he could n0t participate therein. Appareritly, the ligbt laughter of the fair on1y atlraoled his attention, that ho might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlesfneſs reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain wherice it arose: some attributed it to tbedead grey eye, which, fixing upon tho object's face, did not seem to penotrate, and at one glance to pieree through to lhe inward workings of the heort; but fell vpon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could nol pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every houfe; all wished to see him, and those who had been occustomed to vio1ent excilement,and now felt the weight os ennui, were pleased at having somethlng in their presenee capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of hls face, whioh never gained a warmer tint, either from tbe blush of modesty, or fram the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attenti-\nons, and gain, at loast, some marks of wbat they mightterm afsection: Lady Mercer, who hadbeen the mockery os every monster shewn in drawing-rooms sinco her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did clll 6ut pul on the dress of a mountebarik, to attract bis notlce:—though in uain:—when fho stood before him, though his cyes were clpparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were uripercejved;—evcn her unappcllled impudence was bafsled, and fhe Ieft the sield. But thougb the comm0n adultrefs could not influenoe even the guidanceof hjs eyes, it wcls not that the female sex was indifferenl to him: yet sucb was tbe apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wlfe and innocent daughler, that few knew he ever addressed hlmself t0 semaleſ. He had, however, tbe reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that lt even overcaine the dread of hif singular character, or that lhey wero moved by his opparont hatred of vice, he was os often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domeſtic virtues, as amorig those who sully it by their vicef.\nAbout the same time, there cclme to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an 0rphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealtb, by parents who died while he was yet inchildhood. Left also to himself by guardianſ, who thoughl it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they reliriquished the more important charge of bjs mlnd to tbe care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated moro his imagination than his judgment. He had, henee, that higb ramantic fecling of honour and candour, which daily ruins sa many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thaught that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottagemerely consisted in the vestirig of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter'seye by lheir irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that tho dreams of poetf were the realities af life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay eircIes, mclny rnothers surrounded him, striving which should descrlbe with least truth their longuishing or romping favouritos: the daughters at the fame time, by their brightening countenances wben he approached, and by their sparkling eyos, when he opened his lips, soon led hirn into false riotions os his talents and hjs merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he wcls startled at finding, that, exccpt iri the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snvffing, there was no fouridation in real llfe for any of that congerieſ of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in thoso volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some cornpensation ln bis gratjfied vanity, he waſ about to relinquifh his dreams, wben the extraordinary 6eing we have above described, crassed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the vcry imp0ssi-\nbility of f0rming an idea of the charac-\nter of a man entirely abforbed in himſelf, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, irnplied hy the avoidance of tbeir c0ntaet: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flclttercd its propensity to extravagant ideas, he foon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe lhe 0ffspring of hif fancy, rather thon tho person before bim. He became acquclinted with him, paid him ottentions, and so far advanced upon his n0tice, that his presenee was always recognised. He gradua1ly learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were ombarrasscd, and foon found, from the notes os preparation in — Streot, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gainirig some informatjon respecting this singular character, wbo, till now, had on1y whetled his curiosity, he hinted to hjs gvardians, tbal it was time for bim to perform the lour, which for many generatians bas been thought necessary to enable the yourig to take sorne rapid ftepf in tho career of vice towclrds puttirig lhemselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing thcm to appear as if follen from the fkie s, whenever scandalous intriguos are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, accarding to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately menlioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receiue from him a proposalto join him. Flattered by sucb a mark of esteem from him, who, appclrcntly, had nothingin common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passcd the circling waters.\nHitherlo, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he f0und, that, though many more of his aclions were exposed to his view, the results ofscred diffcrent conclufjoris fram the apparent motives to hls conduct. His cornpanion was profuse in his liberallty;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to reliove their immediate waritf. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that hc hestowed his a1ms;—these were senl from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when thc profIigate came to ask something, not to relieve hjs wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still dceper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him t0 the greater lmportunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness 0f the virtuouf lndigent. There was one circumstanee about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more jmpressed upori hiſ mind: all th0se upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably fovrid that there was a curse upon il, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At BrusseIs and other towns through whjch they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion saught for the oentres af all fashionable vice; there be entered into all thespirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambIod with success, except where tbe known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the saine urichanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, howevcr, so when he enoounlered the rash youthf ul navice, or the luckless fatber af a numerous samily; then hif very wlsh seemed fortune's law—this apparenl abstractedness of mind was laid aſide, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cot whilst dallying witb the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left tho formerly affluent youth, torn from tbe circlo he adorned, cursing, in the soIitvde of a dungeon,lhe fate that had drawn him wlthin the roach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks af mute hungry childreri, without a single farthirig of hjs late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficiont to fatisfy their prefent cravirig. Yet he took no money from thc gambling table; but lmmediately lost, to tho ruirier of many, tbe Iast gilder he had just sncltched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this migbt but be tho resvlt of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combatirig the cunning of the more experiencod. Aubrey often wished to represent thif to his friend, clndbeg him to resign that charity and pleasvre which proved lhe ruin of all, and did nottend to his own profit;—but he dela yod it—for each day hehoped his friend would give bim some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthveri in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was aIways the same: his eye ſpoke less than his lip; and though Aubrcy was near the object of bis curiosity, hc obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vain1y wishing to break that mystery, wbich to bif exalled imagination began to assvme the clppearance os something fupernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he 1eft him in daily attendance upon the marning circ1e of an Italian countess, whilsl he went in fearch of the memorials of another alrnoft deſerted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from Erigland, which he opened with eager impatience; lhe sirst waf from his sisler, breathing nothing but affecllon; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it bad hefore entered into his imaginationthat there was an evil power resident in his compariion, theseseemed to give him ſufficient reoson for the belief. His guardians inslsted upon bis immodiately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully viciovs, for that tbe possession of jrrefistible powers of seductlon, rendered bis licentjous habits more dangerous to fociety. It had been discovered, that bis conternpt for the adultrosshad not originated in hatredof her character; but that he bad required, to enhance his gr atlficatjon, lhat hif victim, the partner of his gui1l, shovld be hurledfrom the pinnaole of unsulliod virtue, down to the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation:in fine, that all those femalos wham he had sought, apparently on account os thoir virtue, had, since his departure, thrown everi the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expase the whole d eformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey delermined upon leavirig one, whose character had not yet shown a single brjght poinl on whjch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretexl for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in tbe mean while, to watch him more closely, arid to let no slight cirevmstances pass by unnoticed. He cntered into the same circle, and soon peroeived, tbat his Lordship was erideclvouring to work upon tbe inexperlence of the daughter of the lady whose h0use he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimarried female is met wlth in society; hc was therefore ob1iged to carry on his plans in secret;but Avbrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that on assignation had been app0inted, which would most likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, though thoughtless girl. Losingno time, he entered the apartment of Lord Rulhven, and abruptly asked him his intentions wilh respect to the lady, jnforming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to rneel her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, thal his intentions were such as he supposed all would bave upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wriling a note, to say, that from that momenl he must decline accompanyjng his Lordship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only wjth regard to hor daughter, 6ut also concerning the character of his Lordshjp. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely scnt his servarit to notjfy his completo aſsent t0 a separcltion; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interpositiori.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps lowards Greece, and crossing the Penlnsula, soon found himself at Athens. He lhen fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronlcling lhe deedſ of freemen only bcfore slaves, hcld hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or mony c0loured lichen. Under the sclme roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and deIicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourlray ori canvassthe promised hope of tbe faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that ber eyes spoke too much inind for any one to think she could belong to lh0se wbo had no s0uls. As she dancod upon the plairi, or tripped alorig the mountain's side, one wovld have thaught the gaze1le a poor type of her b eauties; for whowould have exohanged her eye, opparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious Iook of lhe animal suited but to lbe taste of an epicure. The light ftep of Ianthe oflen accompanied Aubrey jnhis search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of o Kashmere butterfly, shaw the whole beauty of ber form, floating as it were upon the wind, to tbe eager gazc of him, who forgot the letters he had iuft decyphered upori an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplatlon 0f her sylph-like figure. Often would ber trosses falling, as she flitted oround, exhibit in the sun's ray sueb delicately bri1liant and fwiftly fading hues,il rnight well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It waſ innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifljng balIs. Whilst ho drew thafc remains of which he wished to preserve a meinorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and wcltch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would tben descri6e to him the circling dance upon lhe open pIain, would point, to him in all the glowing colours os youthful memory, thc marriage pomp sheremembered viewing jri her infancy; and then, turning to svbjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her eo rnestnesf and apparent belies of what sbe narrated,exciled the interest even os Aubrey; and often as she told hirn lhe tale of the living vampyre, who bad passed yoars amidft hjs friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a louely female to prolong his existence f0r the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of oldmeri, who had at lasl detected one living among themselvos, after several of their riear rolatives and children had been found marked with the slamp of the fiend's appetite; and when sbe found him so incredulous, she begged of hlm to believe her, for it had been, remarked, tbat those who had dared toquestion tbeir existence, always had some proof giveri, whieh obliged them, with grief arid heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the tradilional appearance of these monsterf, ond his horror was increased, by bearirig a protty accvrate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still porsisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in hcr fears, thaugh at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excitc a belief in the fupernaturaI power of Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so controstcd wilh all tho affected virtucs of lhe women am0ng whom he had sought for hjs visi0n of romarice, won hls heort; and whilo he ridiculed lheidea of a young mcln of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, slill he found hjmself more and more attachod to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian rescarch, he wovld depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but hc always found itirnpossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around bim, whilst iri his mind he retained an iinage that seemed alone the rightful posscfsor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconsciaus of hjs love, and was ever the same frank infanti1e being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him witb reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she couId visit her favourite haunts, whjlst ber guardian was oc cupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped tbe destructivo band of timc. She bad appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, wjth several present, affirmed their existenc o, pale with horror at the very naine. Soon aftor, Aubrey determined to proceed vpon one of his excursions, wbich was to detairi himfor a sew haurs;when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him nol to return at night, as he must necessorily pass through a wood, where no Greek wouId euer remain, afler lhe day had cl0sed, upon any consideration. Tbey described it as the resort of the vampyres in lhejr noctumal orgies, and denou nced the moſt heclvy evils af lmpending upan him who dared ta oross thcir path. Aubrey made light of their represeritcltioris, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder al his darlng thus to mock a superior, lnfernal power, the very name of whicb apparently made their blood free2e, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon bis excursion unatterided; bewas surpr ised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of thofo h0rrible fiends, hod inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came lo the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of hjm to rolum, orc night allowed the powerof thesc beings to be pul in action;—he promised. He was, however, so oocupied ln his research, that ho did not perceive lhat day-light wouldsoon erid, and that in tbe horizon therc was ane of those specks which, in the warmer climatos, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their ragc upori the devoted cauntry.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but lt was too late. Twilight, in these southern climatcs, is almost unknown; lmmediately the sun sets, night begins: arid ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had soarcely an interva1 of rest—its thick heclvy rain forcod itf way through the canapying foliage, wbilst the 6lue forked ligbtning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feel. Svddenly bis horſe took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the enlangIed forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he fourid, by the glare of lightriing, lhat he wasin the neighbourhood os a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from lhe pelting of the storrn. As he approached, the thunderf, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrioks of a womcln mingling wjth the ftifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continuod in 0ne almost uribroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder whicb again rolled ouer his hcad, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in vttcr darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He wcls apparently unperceived; sor, though ho called, still tbo sounds coritinued, and no notice was taken of him. He faund hiinself in contact with some one, whorn he immediately ſelzed; when o voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh ſucceeded; and he felt hiinself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to soll hlſ life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he waslifted from his feet and hurIed withenormous foree against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon bis brcast, had placed his hands upori hif throat—wben the glaro of many torches penetrating thr0ugh lhe hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him;—be instantly r0se, and, leaving bis prey, rushed lhrough the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through lhe waod, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable 0f m0ving, was soon heard by th0se without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes ofsoot. At the desire of Aubrey they seorched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again lest in darkness; but wbot was his horror, when the light of the torches once rnore burst upon him, to perceive the ajry f0rm of his fair conductress brought in o lifeless corsc. He shut his eyes, hoping that it waſ bul a vision clrising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, wben he unclosed tbem, slretched by bis side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face tbot seemed cllmost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon herneck and breast waf blood, and upon her throat were thc marks of teeth having opened tbe vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultarieously slruck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had Iately been to him the object of so many brlght and fairy visions, now fallen with tbe flower of life thal had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed lo shun reflcction, orid take refuge jn vacancy—he heId almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of cl par ticular constructjon, which had been found inthe hut. They were soon met hy different parties who had been erigaged in the search of hcr whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, os they approacbed the clty, forewarnedthe parents of some dreadfvl catostrophe. —To doscribe their grief would be jmpossible; but when they afcerlalned tbe causc of their cbjld's dealh, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They wcre inconsolable; both died broken-heclrted.\nAubrey being put to hed was seized with a m0st violent fever, and was often delirious; in theſe intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthvon and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combinatiori he seemed to beg of his sormer companiori to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecote maledictlons upon his head, and ourse him cls her deslroyer. Lord R uthven,chanced at this time to arrivc at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himse1f in lhe same h0vse, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrlfied and stclrtled clt the sight of him whose image he bad now combined with lhat of a Vainpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for thc fault that had cavsed their ſeparation, ond still mare by the attcntion, anxiety, and care which ho showed, soon reconclled him to his presence. His lordship secmed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convaIescence began lo be ropid, ho again gradually relired into the same state of mind, andAubrey perceivod n0 difference from the former man, excepl that at times he was surprised t0 meet his gaze flxed intently upon him, withcl smile of malicious exultaljon playing upon his lips: he knew nol why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wavef raisedby lhe cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless suri;—indeed, he appcaredto wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by tbis shock, was mucb weakened, and that eIasticity of spirit which had once so dislinguished him now seeined to hclve fled for ever. He was now as much cl lover of solltude and silence as Lord Rvthvcn; but much as he wifhed for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atheris;if he s0ught it amidst the rvins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it ln the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; lhen suddenly turning rovnd, would sbow, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile vpon hcr lips. He determined to fly scenes, every featurc of which created such bitterassociations jn hls mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhveri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken af bim during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. Tbey travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus haslened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robberſ, but they gradualIy began t0 slight tbesc reportf, which they imagined werc anly the jnvcntion of individuaIs, whose intcrest it was to excltetbe generofity of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled wilhonly a few guords, more to serve as guides thari as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom 0f wbich was the bed af a torrent, with large massos of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they bad reason to repent their negligenee; for scarcelywero the wbole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, whon they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guris. In an instant their guards had 1eft them, and, placing themselves hehind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction wherice the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, irnitating their example, retired for o moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: butashamed of bejng thus detained by a foe, who with lnsulting shovts badc them advan ce, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers shovld climb a6ove and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in ſearch of the enemy. Hardly had they losl the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shovlder, which brought him lo the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asfistance; and, no longer heeding lhe contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by soeing the robbers' faces arourid him—his guclrds having, upon Lord Ruthveri's being wounded, immediately thrown up thejr arms and surrendercd.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon jnduced them to convey his wounded sriend to a neighbouring cabiri; clnd having agreod upon a ransom, he was no more dlstvrbed by their preserice—they being eontent merely to guard the entrance till their c0mrade should return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveri's strength rapidly decreased; in two dayf inortificatlon ensued, and death seemed advanclrig with hasty stepſ. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had 6een 0f the objects about him: but towards the close of thc last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, clnd his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may saveme—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of tbe passing day; but you moy save my honour, yovr srjend's hanour.\"—\"How? lelI me how? I would d0 any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot exploin tho who1e—but if you would conccal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world'f mouth—and if my death were unknown far some time jn England—I—I—but ljfe.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Sweclr!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultont violence, \"Swear by all your foul reveres, by all your nature fears, sweor that, for a year and cl day you will not i mpart your knowledge of my crimes or death toany living being jn any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyef seemed burstirig from their sockots: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acqu-\nalntance wjth this man rose upon his mlnd, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivoring cclme over him, cls lf from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the mornjng, he was about to enter lhe hovel in whioh he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that jt was no longer there, having beon conveyed by bimself arid comrados, upan his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbovring mount, according lo a promife thcy had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray os the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astoriished, and taking several of tbe meri, determined to go and bury jt upon the spot wbore it lay. But, when he had mounted to tho summit he fovnd no traco of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers sworc they pointed out the identical rock on which thcy had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last retumed, convinced lhat they had buried the corpse for thc sake af the cl0lhes.\nWeary of a c0untry in which he had met with such terrible misf0rtunes, and in which all apparently conspired to beighten that superstitious molancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved t0 leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waitjng for a vessol to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging thoso offects he had with him helonging to Lord Rvthven. Amongst other things there wcls a case containjng feveral wcapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the viotim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Wh ilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dag ger djscovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he fourid the weapori, and his horror mcly be lmagined when he discovered that jt fitted, thaugh peculiarly fhaped, the sheath he held iri his hand. His eyes scemed to need no further certainly—theyseemod gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished ta diſbelieve; but the particulor form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alikc in splendour on both, and left no room far doubt; there were also drops of b lood on each.\nHo left Smyrna, and on hls way home, at Rome, his fjrst inquirieſ were concernirig the lady he had attempted to snatch froin Lord Ruthven's sedvctive arts. Her pclrents werc in distreſs, their fartunc ruined, and she had not been heard of fince the departure of hls lordship. Aubrey's mind became a1mosl broken under so many repeated horr0rs; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the deſtrayer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and hlsonly occupation cansisted in vrging thespeed of the postilions, as if he weregoing to save the life os some one he hold dear. He arrived at Calcliſ; a breeze, wbich seemed obedient to his wlll, soan wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of hlf fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of lhe past. If shebefore, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the womari began lo appear, she was still more att-\naching as o companjon.\nMiss Aubrey had n0t that winning grace wbich goins tbe gaze and a pplause of the drawing-room assem6lies. There was norie of lhat light brilllancy whlcb only exis ts in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was nevor lit up by the 1evity ofthc mind beneath. There wos a melancholy charm about it which did riat seem to arise froin misfortune, but from sorne feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that ligbt footing, which strays where'er a butlerfly or a colovr may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When al0ne, her sace was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his afsection, arid wouId in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if tbose eyes,—that face were then playing in tbe light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presenled to the world, it having been tbought by her guardians morefit that her presentcltiori should be delclyed until her brother's return from lhe conlirient, whcn he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drclwing-roam, whicb was fast clpproaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remajned in lhe mansiori of his falhers, and sed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could n0t feel interest ahout the frivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind hadbeen so torn by the events he had wilnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived iri town, and prepared for the next day, whjch had been announcod as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excefsive—a drawing-room had not boen held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bosk in the smile of royalty, hastened thilher. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was st anding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engoged in lhe remembrance that the first tjmo he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—hefelt himself suddenly seized by the arrn, and a v0ice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spoctre that would blastbim, when he perceived, at a little dislance, the same figure which had clttracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into soeiety. He ga2ed till his limbf alinost refusing to bear tbeir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcjng a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into hiscarriage, and was drivcn home. He paced the room with hurrjed steps, and fixed his harids upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting fromhis brain. Lord Ruthven ogoin before him—circuinstances started up in dreadfuI array—the dagger—bis oath.—He roufed himself, ho could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had oonjured up the image his mind was refting upon. It was impossible that it co uld be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for lhough he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthveri, the name hung upori his lips, and hecovld not succeed in gaining informatiori. He went a few nigbls aster with his sisler to the assembly of o near relation. Leaving her under lhe protection of a rnatron, he retired into a recefs, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceivlng, at last, that many were leaving, he roused hirnscls, and entering another room, found his ſlster surroundod by several, apparently in earnest conversaliori; he ottempled to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requcſted to move, turned round, and revealed to him thosc features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized hif sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced her towclrdf the street: at tho door he sound himself impeded by the crowd of servonts wh0 were waiting for their lordf; and while he wos engaged in passing tbem, he again heard that voice whifper cl0se to him—\"Remcmber your oath!\"—Hc did not dare loturn, but, hurryinghis sister, soon reached hame.\nAubrey became almosl distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subie ct,how much more completely was it engrossed, now that lhe eertainty os the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attenlions were now unhecded, and it was in vain that sheintreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered cl few words, and those terrified her. The more he th0ught, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;—was he theri to clllow this monstcr to r0am, boaring ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by bim. But even if he were to hreak his oath, and disclose hjs sufpicions, whowould bel leve him? He th0ught of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretcb; but death, he remembered, had been aIready mocked. For days he remclined in lbis state; shut up in his room, he sawna one, and ate only when his sisler came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no langer capable of bearing sti1lness and solitude, he lest his house, roamcd from street to street, anxious t0 fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wclndered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; clt first he returned with the evening to the house; but at 1ast he laid him down lo rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, clnxious for his sasety, employed people to follow him; hut they were soon diftanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with tbe idea that hc left by his clbsenee the whoIe of his frierids, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence theywere uriconscious, he detcrmined to enler again into s0cicty, and watch him clofely, anxiouf lo forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthvon approachod with jntimacy. But when be enteredinto a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so strlking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last o6liged to beg of him to abstain froin seeking, for her sake, a s0ciety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing thclt his mjnd was becoming alienated,they thovght it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon thcm by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he bad daily encountered inhis wanderings, and of preventlngbim from exposing to the general eye those marks of wbat they considered folly, they cngaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant core of him. He hardly oppeared to notiee it, ſo completely wcls his mind abſorbed by one terrible su6ject. His inooherence became at last so great, thal he was confined lo his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had hecome emaciated, his eyes had attairied a glassylustre;—the only sign of afsection and recollectjon remaining displayed itself upon the eritryof his sist er; then he would sometimes ſtart, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not lo touch him. \"Oh, do not touob hlm—if your love for me is aught, do not go near hlm!\" Wben, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his anlyanswer was, \"True! true!\" and agairi he sarik into a state, whence not even she could rouse hlm. Thif lasted many months: grcldually, however, as the year was passing, his iricaherences became less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a portion ofjts gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he w0uld eount upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tlme had nearly elapsed, when, upontbe last day of the year, one of his guardians eriteririg his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melaneholy circumstonce of Aubrey's being in so awful a situatjon, when hjs sister was going riext day to be married. Ins tantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glod os this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, lhey mentioned the name of the EclrI of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met wilh in society, Aubrey seemed pleclsed, ond astonished them still more by his expressing his intention ta be prcsent at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparentIy again capable os being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his brcast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once rnore alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so diftlriguished far rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprlse at beh0ldlrig the features of tbe monstor who had so long iriflucnced his life. He seized the portroit in a paroxysm of ragc, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thvs destroyed the rosemblancc of her future husbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frontic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance—jt seemed as if that voice again bade him reinernber his oalh—he turned sudderily round, thinklng Lord Ruthven waſ near him bul saw no one. In the meanlime the guardians and phyſician, who had heard the wholo, and thought this was but a return ofhis disorder, entered, and foroing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he iinpl0red, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this lo lhe insanity thoy imagined hod taken pofsession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with evcry one elſe. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily uriderslaod himself to be lhe causc of it; but wheri he leamed that he was deemed insanc, his exultatlon and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the houso of his former companion, and, by oonstant attendance, and tbe pretence of great affectionfor the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear 0f Miss Aubrey. Wha cou1d resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils lo recount—could speak of him self as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the orowded earth, save with her to whoin he addreſsed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existenee, hcld begun to seem worthy of preservation, if jt wcre merely that he might listen to her soothing clcoentf;—in fine, he knew so well how to use thc serpent'f art, or such was the will of fate, that be gained her affections. The litle of the elder branch falling atlength to hirn, he obtained an jmportant embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening tho marriage, (jn spite of her brother's deranged stale,) which was to lake place the very day bofore his departure for the continent.\nAu6rey, when he was left by the physician and bis gvardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was givcn hlm; he wrote o letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the horiour of those now in the grave, who once held her iri their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a sew hours that marriago, 0n which be denounced the most heavy curses. Tho servants promised lhey would deliver it; but giving it to lhe physician, be thought it better not t0 harass any more the mind of MissAuhrey by, what he considered, the rovings 0f o maniac. Night passed on without rost to the busy inmates of the house; and Au6rey board, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, lhe riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound ofcarrjages broke uponbis ear. Aubrey grew alm0st frantic. The cvriosity of the servants clt last overcame their vigilancc, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the eust0dy os an help1ess old waman. He seized thc opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in o momerit found himself in the apartment where all wero nearly asſembled. Lord Rvthven was the first to perceive him: he immedjately approached, and, taking his arm by foree, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispercd in his ear—\"Remembcr your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, be pushed him towards his attendants, who, rousedby the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had brokeri a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bod. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present whori he entered, as the physieian waf afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increclsed; the effusiori of blood produced symptoms of lhe ncar opproach of death. He desired his fister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; bul when they arrjved, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all befare him, where to choose his place ofrest, and Pravidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian ArchipeIago, on board one of bis Mojesty's vesselſ, in tho year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, iri the island af that name. Tbe beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—bothmen of war ond merchantmen; and though il lics rath er out of the trock for sbips bovnd to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyago. We londed; as usual, at the bottom of the 6ay, and whilst the men were employcd in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattIe with the natives, the clergyman and myself look a ramhle to the cave caIled Homer's School, and other ploces, where we had been before. On tbe brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met witb and engaged a young Grcek aſ aur guide, wbo told us he hadcome from Scio with an English lord, who left the islond four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"arid would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylenc, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, hut a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, helorigs lo hiin, and he has left an old man in charge of lt: he gave Dominick, the wine-tr ader, six hundred 2echlnes for it, (abovt L250 Eriglishcurroncy,) and has resided there ab0ut fourteen monthf, though not constantly; for he sails in his selucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excjted ovr curiosity very much, and we lost no tiine in hastening to the house where our countryman had resi ded. Wo were kindly recejved by an o1d man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of sour apartmonts on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, cl drawing-rooin, a sitling parlour, and a bed-room, with cl spacious closet annexed. They woro all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on eitber s ide, a lar ge myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which covld be made ta play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in tbe sidc of a small bronze Venus in a leaning paslure; a large couch or sofa completed the furnilurc. In the hall stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no inirrors, n0r a single painting. The bedchamber had mercly a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilIow—the common bed throvghout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the o1d mcln told us, filled witb books and papers,which were then in a large scaman's chesl in the closet: it was operi, but we did not thjnk ourselvos justified in examining the contents. On tbe tablet of the recesf lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, iri the German Ianguoge; Klopstook's Mefsiah; Kolzebue's riovels; Scbiller's play of the Robberf; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed at Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphlets frorn the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most af these books were filled with marginal notes, writteri with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old mari said: \"The lord had been reading these books the everiirig 6efore he sajled, and forgat to place them with tbe others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie unlil his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without ordcrs, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very gaod. I once did him a service; and I hove lhe producc of this farm for the trouble of lakirig care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in asmall cottagein lhe wood, and whom the Iord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanoe of thc house cxternally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marhle pillars with black pIinths and fret-work cornices, (as itis now customary in Grecian architecturo,) were considerably higher than the roof. Tbe roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a firie Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of str0ng coarse linen. Most os the houso-tops are tbus furnisbed, as upon them the Greeks passtheir everiings in smoklng, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi,\" eating fruit, anderijoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streomlet glided away, grapes, orclnges and ljmos wero clvslcring together on its borders, and under tbe shade of two large myrtle bvshes, cl marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord pasfed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talkjng lo himseIf. \"I suppose,\" said tbe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"arid always attended our church twi ce a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this ſeat was what may bc termed \"a bird's-eyeview.\" A line of rieh vineyards led lhe eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stroam lssuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was losl in lhe woodsnear the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadawed by a single cloud, terminatesthe uiew in front; and a little ori the left, through a vlsta of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wove with spols of emerald greeri. I seldoin enjoyod a uiew inore than I did thif; but our enquiries were frultlesſ as to tbe name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his bankcr, who bad gone to Candia. \"Tbe Armcnian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, 6utI am sure he will not,\"—\"And cann0t you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I ean,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit lhe Armenicln, but on our return to the town we leclrnt several particulars of the isolated lo rd. He had portioned eigbt young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, ho rscs to others, and cotton and silk to lhe girls who live by wcaving these articles. He also h0ught a new boat for a fisherman who had loft his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to thc poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old frierid at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a mosl beautiful daughter, with whom thc lord was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and hc hcld bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the inf0rmation with which we deparled from the peaceful islo of Mitylene; our iinaginotions all on the rack, guessing who this ramblcr ln Greece oould be. He had money it was evident: he hod philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculior geniuf. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who hcld been trave1ling in Egypt and Greeco, \"Thc individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxi0us, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trclvels on theiſlarid of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame,as we had been some years from home; but \"Chjlde Harolde\" being put into our hands we reoognized the recluse of Calc1a in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottoge, but wc consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylerie on some future day; but to me lhat day will never rcturn. I make this statemenl, believlng it nol quile uninteresting, and iri justice to his lordship's good narno, whlch has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an urifeeling disposjtion, averse to associatirig with buman nature, or contributing in any way to sooth lts sorrowf, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reversc, as mayhe plajnly gathored from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings os the heart, so elegantly depictod in his lordship's poems, seem to have lheir seat in his boſorn. Tenderness, fympclthy, and ehclrity appoar to guide all his octions: and his courting tho repoſe of solitudeis an additional reason far rnarking hiin as a beirig on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevalericehath thrown hermantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryrnan. Wilh respecl to his loues 0r pleasures,I do riot assvme a right to give an opinion. Reports are over to be received with caution, particularly when direcled against man's morol integrity; and he who dares justify himself hefore that awfuI tribunal wbere all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good ln seoret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testjmony 0f a virtuous heart and felf-approving c0nscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crowri-oovrt, Fleet-street.",

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidorl\nTHE svperstition upon which this tole is founded is very general in lhe East. Among the Arabiaris it appears to be cammon: it did ri0t, howcver, extend itself to tbe Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed itf present form fince the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, lhat a Latin body could not corrupt ifburied in thoir torritory, il gradually increaſed, and formed the subject of many wondersul stories, still extant, 0f tbe dead ris ing from their graves, and secding upon the 6lood of tho young and beautiful. In the West it ſpread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existcd, that vampyros nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who beeame emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily dled os consumptions; whiIst thefe human blood-suekers fattened—and their veins beoame distended lo such a state of repletion, as to cause the bload to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores af lheir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accounl of a particular casc of vampyrism, which if stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appeclrs, that upon an examination of the commander-in-cbief and magistrates of the place, they positluely and unanimously affirmed, that, about fiue years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of lhe Turkish Servia, ho had been torinented by a vampyre, but had sound a way lo rid hjmself of the evil, by eating soine of the earth out of the vampyro's grave, and rubbing himself with hif bl0od. This precauli0n, however, did not prevent him frorn becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death clnd burial, many persons complained of having been tarmented by him, and cl deposition wos made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attocks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted thejr Hadagni, took up the body, ond found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh,and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Praof having been tbus obtained, they resarted lo lhe accustomed remedy. A ſtake was driven entirely through the hearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he if reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were odoptod with the corses of those persoris who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon olhers who svrvived lhem.\nThe universal be lief is, that a porson sucked 6ya vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his lvm.\nCbief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rod0montade is here reIated, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject af the present observations than any other instarice which could be adduced. In many p arts of Greece it iſ considered as cl sort os punishment after death, for some heinous erime commitled whilst in existence, that thc deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compolled to confine his infernol visitatioris salely to those belngs heloved most whiIe upan earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindrcd and affection.—Asuppositiori allvded to in the \"Giaovr.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy c0rse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghast1y haunt the native placo, And suek the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet whicb porforce Must seed thy livjd living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know tbe demori f0r their sire; As cvrsirig thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for lhy crime rnust fall, The youngest, best beloved of oll, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap lhy hearl in flamc! Yet thau must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—bcr eye's lclst spark, Aridthe last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'cr its lifolesf blue; Theri with unhaIl0wed hand shall tear The tresses of her ycllow hajr, Of which, jn life a lock when shorn Affection's fondost pledge was worn— But now is borne away by lhoe Memorial of thi ne agoriy! Yet with tbirie own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, G0—and with Goulſ and Afrits rave, Till these jn horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corso of the Arabian moid Oneiza, who is represented af having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best lovedwbilst in existon ce. But this cannot be ſupposod to have refulted from the sinfulness 0f her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veraoious Tovrnefart giv es a long account in his travels of several oslonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of aneodotes, and tradltjonary narratives illvstrative of its effects, has put farth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to 6e a c1assical, as well aſ barbarian error.\nMany curious and intereſting nolices on this singularly horrible supcrstition might be added; thovgh the presenl may suffice for the limits of o note, nccessorily devotcd lo explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, tbat th0ugh the term Vampyro is the one in most general acceptation, there are severa1 others synonymous with it, made use 0f in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that ln the midst of the dissipatioris attendant upon a London winter, lhere appeared at the variaus parties of the leaderf os the tori anobleman, more remarkable for his singularitles, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around hiin, as ifhe could not participate lherein. Appclrently, the light laughter of lhe fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts w here thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whonce it arose: sorno altributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce lhrough to the iriward workirigs of the heart; but sell upon the cheek with a leaden ray thal weighed upon the skin it could n0t pass. His peculiarities causod him to be invited to every houſe; oll wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were ploased at having somethirig in their presence eapable of engagjng their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, whieh never goined a warmer tint, ejther fr0m the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its f0rm and 0utline were beautifu1, many of the female huriters aster notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery af every morister shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in hif way, arid did al1 but put on the dress of a mounlebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—wheri she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently sixed upon her's, stilI it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could nol influence even the guidance of hjſ eyes, it wos not that the female sex was indifferent lo him: yet svch was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocenl daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himseIf to females. He had, however, the reputationof a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular charaeter, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, be waf as often among lhose females who form lhe boast of lhelr sex from their domestic virtues, as among those wh0 sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, th ere came t0 London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: ho was an orphan left with an only sisler in lbe possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his sortune, whilc they rclinquished thc morc important charge os bis rnind to lhe care os mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination thcln his iudgment. He had, hence, that higb romantic foeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to ſympathise with virtve, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that tho misery of a eottage merely corisisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adaptcd to tho palnter's eye by thejr irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in flne, that tbe dreams of poets were the realities of life. He wos handfome, frank, and rieh: forthese reasons, upon his cntering into the gay circleſ, many mothers surrounded him, ſtriving which should describe wjlh leclst trutb t heir languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the ſame time, by their brightcning countenances when he appraached, and by tbeir sparkllng cyes, wheri he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of hls talents and his merit.Attached as he was to thc romonce of his solitory hours, he was startled at finding, that, excepl iri the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a gbost, hut from want of snuffing, therc was no foundation ln real lifo for any os that congeries of pleaſing plctures and dcscriptions oontained in those volumes, from which he had formcd his study. Finding, howe-\nver, somo compensatiari in his gratified vanity, he waſ aboul to rclinquish his dreams, when the extrclordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility os forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave fcw ather signs of his observation of e xtomal objects, than the tacitassent to their existence, impIied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination ta picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon sormed this object into the heroof a romance, and detormined to obſerve theoffspring of his fanoy, rather than the person bofore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentioris, arid so fclr advanced upon his riotice, that his pre senco was always recogriised. He gradually 1earnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and ſoon found, fram the notes of preparationin — Street, that he was abovt lo trauel. Desirous of gaining some information respectirig this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hirited to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the taur, which for many generotions has been thought necessary to enablo the young to take some rapid sleps ln the career 0f vice towards putti ng thoinselvos upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scanda1ouf intrigues are menlioned os the ſubjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying thern 0n. They consented: and Aubrey immodiately mentioning hjs intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from bim a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him,wbo, apparontly, had nothing in comman with other men, be gladly accepted it, and in afew days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Au6rey had had rio opportunity of studying Lord Ruthveri's charactcr, and now he found, that, though rnany mare of his actionſ were exposed to his view, the results offered differenl c0nclusioris from lhc apparent motives t0 his ooriduct. His c0mponion was profuse inhis liberality;—the idlc, the vagabond, and the beggar, received srom his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wanls. But Aubrey cou1d not auoid remarking, that it was not up0n the virluous, redvced to indigence by the rnisfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bostowed his alms;—thefe were sent from thedoor with hardly suppressed sneers; but when thc profligale come to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper iri bis iniquity, hc was serit away wjth ricb charity. This was, however, attributed by hiin to the greater importunjty of the vicious, whicb generally provails 0ver the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Thore was one oircumstarice about the charity of his Lordship, whieh was still more impressed upon hismind: aIl those upori whom lt was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffald, or sunk to thc lowest and the most abject misery. AtBrussels and other tawns through whioh they passed, Aubrcy was surpri2ed at the apparent eagcrness with which his companion sought sor the centres of aIl fashionable vice; there he entered into all tbe spirit of the faro table: he hetted, and always gamblcd with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then helost even more than he gclined; but it was alwayf with the same unchangingface, with which he gerieralIy watchedtbc society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or tbe luckless father of a numer0us family; tben his very wish seemed fortune's lclw—this apparcrit abslractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes spa-\nrkled with more fire than tbat of the cat whilst dallying with the half-deod inouse. In every town, heleft the forrnerly affluent yauth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursjng, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sato that had drawnhim withiri the reacb of lhis fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking lookſ of mute hungry children, without a singlefarthirig of his late irnmense weaIth, wherewith to bvy even svfficient to fatisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the rui ner of mariy, the last gilder he had jvſt snatched from tbe convulsive grasp of thc innocent: this mlght but be the result of a certain degree of kriowledge, which wcls not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienccd. Avhrey often wished to rcpresent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleaſure which provedthe ruin of all, and did nol tend to his own profit;—bul he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend wouId give him some opportunity os speaking frankly and openly to him; bawever, this never occurred. Lord Rutbveri in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyc spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratificatjori from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break tbat mystery, which to his exalted imaginalion bcgan to assume the appearance of somelhing supernalural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a tjmo lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily clttendance upon the morriing cirele of an Italian c ountess, whilst he went in search of the memorialſ of another almost deserted city. Whilst hewas thus engaged, letters arrived from England, wbich ho opened with eager impatienoe; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were srom his guclrdians, the latter astonished hjm; if it had before entercd into his imagination that there was an euil power resident in hls companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his lmmediately leauing hls friend, and urged, that hif choracter waf dreodfully vjcious, for that the possessioriof irresistible p0wers of seduction, rendered his licontious habits more dangerous to society. It had beendiscovered, thclt his contempt far the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had requircd, to enhance hjs gratification, that his victim, the par tner of his guilt, should behurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of tbeir virtue, hcld, sjnce his departure, thrown evon the mask asjde, and had not scrupled to expase thc whole deformity of their vices to the public gclze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjngle brigbt point on whlch to rest the eye. Ho resolved to invent ſome plausiblc pretexl for abandoning hjm altogether, purposirig, in the mean whi le, to watch birn rnore closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daugbter of the Iady whose bouse he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he waſ thorefore obliged to carry on his pIanſ in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all bis wjndings, and soon discoucrcd that an clssignation had been appoinlod, which would most likely end in the ruin os an innoccnt, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered tbe apartmont of Lord Ruthven, and clbruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the fame time that he was awore of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answered, that his intentions were such as he supp0sed a1l wovld have up0n svoh an occasion; and upon being prcssed whetber he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment be must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of thejr proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and ca1ling upon the mother of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not orily with regard to her daughter,but also concerning the oharacter of his Lordsbip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Rutbven next day merely sent bis servant lo natify hif complete ossent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the PeninsuIa, soon found hlmself at Athens. He then fixod his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himsolf jn tracing the faded recards of ancient glory upon monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only bef ore slaves, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soi1 or many coloured 1ichon. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, fo beautiful and delicate,thclt she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she dariced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain'ſ side, one would have thougbt the gaze1le a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently tbe eye of ariimated naturc, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the laste of an epicure. Tbe light ſtep of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his searcb after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kclshrnore butterfly, show the whole beauty os her sorm, f1oating as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had juft dccyphoredupon an almost effaced tablet, in lhe contemplation of her sylph-like figvre. Often would her lresses fal1lng, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray suob delicately brilliant and swiflly fading hues, it might well excuse lhe forgetsvlness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the vcry abiect he bad before lhovght of vitol importance ta the proper iriterprelation of a pasſage in Pausonias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wishcd to preserue a memorial for his future hours, she wou1d sland by, and wotch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes os her native place; she would theri describe to him lhe circling dance upon the open plain, would point, to him in all the glowing colovrs of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembcred viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mjnd, would tell him all the supernatural tales os hernvrse. Her earnestness and apparent bellef of what she narrated, excited the interest evenof Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, wbo had passed years amidsl his frionds, and dearest ties, f0rced every year, by foeding upon the life of a lavely semale to prolong bls existcnoe for the ensuing months, hiſ bload would run cold, whilst he ottempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found markcd witb the stamp of the fiend's clppetlte; and when she sound him so incredulavs, she begged of him to helieve her, for it had been, rcmarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proaf given, which obliged thern, with grief arid heartbreaking, lo corisess il was lrue. She detailed lo him the traditional appearance of these monsters, clnd his harror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate doscription of Lord Ruthven; he, however, stlll persisted in persuading ber, that there covld be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the rnany cojncidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her lnnocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women omong whom he had saught for his vision os romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducclted Greek girl, still he found himse lf more and more attached to the a1most fajry form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a p1an for some antiqvarian reſearch,he would depart, determined not to retvrn until his object was attained; but be always found it jmposſib1e to fix bis attention upon the ruins around him, whllst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful posfessor of his lboughts. Ianlhe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frarik infantile being he had first knowri. Shc always feemed lo part fr0m him with reluctonce; but it was because she hcld no longer any ono with whom she eovld visit her favourite haunts, whilst her gvardian was occupied in sketching or uncoverjng some fragment whieh had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parerits on tho subject of Vainpyres, and they both, with several p resent, affirmod their existence, pale with horror al lhe very name. Soon after, Aubrey determlned to proceed upon ono of his exeursioris, which was to detain hirn for a few hours; whon they heard tbe name of the place, they all at once begged of him nol to return al night, as he must necessarily paſs thraugh a woo d, where no Greek would ever remairi, after the day had elosed, upon any consideration. Tbey described it as the resort 0f the vampyres in their riocturnal orgies, and denounced the most beavy evils as impending upon hlin who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representotions, and lried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw tbem shudder at his darlng thus to mock a ſuperlor, irifernal power, lhe veryname of which apparently inade their blood freeze, he was silont.\nNext m0rning Auhrey sel off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the me1aricholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrib1e fiends, had inspired them with suchterror. When he was abovt to deparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night ollowed the power of theso bcings to be put in action;—he prornised.He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he dld not perceivo that day-light would soon end, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gclther into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage vpon the devoted country.—He at lclst, howevcr, mounted his horse, deterinjned to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in those southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, nlght begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—itſ echoing thunders had scaroely ari inlerval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his uery feet. Svddenly hishorso took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through lhe enlclngled forost. The animal at last, through fatigve, stopped, and he found, by the glclre os lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardIy lifteditse1f up from lhe masses of dead leaves andbrushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some orie to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he opproached, the thunders, for amoment silcnt, allowed him t0 hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stif1ed, exultant mockery of a laugh, continved in one almost unbroken sound;—he wasstartled: but, roused by tbe thunder which again rolled over his head, he, wjth a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darknesſ: the sound, however, guided him. He was app-\narently unperccived; for, tbough he caIled, still the sourids continued, and no notlce was laken of him. He found himself in eontact with somc one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himfelf grappled hy one whoſe strength seemed svperbuman: determined to sell his life as dearly af he could, he struggled; butit was in vain: he was Iifted srom his feet and hurlod with enorrnovs force agalnſt the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, andkneeIing upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare 0f mclny torches penetratlng thr0ugh the hole that gave light jn the day, disturbed hjm;—he instantly rose, and, leaving hls prey, rvshed through the door, and in a moment the crashirig of the brancheſ, as he broke through lhe wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They onlered; the light of their torches fell upon thc mud walls, and the thatcb loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the defire of Aubrey they searched for her who bad altracted bim by her cries; he was again Ieft in darkness; but what was his horror,when the light 0f tbe torchef once more burst upon him, to peroeive the airy f0rm of his falr conductress brought ln a lifel ess corse. He shut his eyes, hoping tbat it was bvt a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, wheri he unclosed thern, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cbeek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as atlaching as the life that onee dwelt thore:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon hcr throat were tbe marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this tbe men pointed, crying, siinultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey waf 1aid by the side of her who had lately boeri to him lhe object of so many bright and fairy vlsions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his lhoughts werc—his mind was benumbed and seemed to ſhun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost vnconsciovsly in his hand a naked dagger of a partieular construction, which had been f0und ln the hut. They were soon met by difforent parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamenlable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the porents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe tbeir grief would be impossible; but wheri they afcertained the cause of their child's dealh, they looked al Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsoIable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violerit feuer, and was often delirious; in these intervals he wouldcall upon Lord Ruthven arid upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg os his former companion to spare lhe being he loved. Al other tirnes he would im precale maledictions upon hiſ bead, and curse hiin as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately plaeed himself ln the samc hovse, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified andstarlled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with thatof a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words,implyjng a lmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separotiori, and still more by the attention, arixiety, and care which he showed, soon recoriciled him ta his presence.His lordship seemcd qujte changed; ho no longer appcared that apathetic bejng who had so astonished Auhroy; but as soon as hif convalescence began to berapid, he again gradua1ly retired into the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived no differencc from theformer man, except that al times he was surprised to mcet bis gaze fixed inte ntly upon him, with asmile of malici0us exultatjon playirig upon his lips: he knew nat why, but this smile haunlcd him. Durlng the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was clpparontIy engaged iri wotching the tideless waves raised by the oooling brecze, or in markingthe progress of those orbs, circling, like our wor1d, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish ta avojd the eyef of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seomed to have fled f0r ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as be wished for folitude, his mind covld not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sougbt it amidst the ruins he bad forme rly frequented, Iclnthe's form stood by his ſide—is he sought it iri the woods, her light step would appear wanderingamidsl the underwood, in quest 0f lhe m0dest violet; tben suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wounded throat, with a rneek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of whlch created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to wbom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his iIlness, that they should visit tbose partsof Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every diroclion, and sovght every spot to whieh a recolleetjon cov1d be attached: 6ut thovgh they thuſ hastened frorn place ta plaoe, yet they seemed notto heed whal lhey gazed upon. They heard muchof robbers, but they grcldually began to slight these reports, whicb they imagined were only the jnvenllon of individuals, whose interesl it was to excite tbe generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequenee of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabilants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, m0re to serve as guides lhan as a defenoe. Uponentering, howeuer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bedof a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent thelr negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pasſ, when they were ftortled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of seueral guns. Iri an instclnt their guards had left them, and, pIclcing themselves behindrocks, had begun to flre in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating th eir exomple, rctired for a mornent behind the sheltering turn of the defjle: but ashamed of 6eing thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shauts bade lhcm advance, and being expased to unresistlng slclvghter, is any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rvsb forward in seareh of the enemy. Hardly had thcy lost the shelter of the r0ck, when Lord Ruthven recolved a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to hiſ assistance; and, no longer heeding the c0ntest or his own peril, was so0n surpriscd by seeing the robbers' faces around hlm—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthveri's being wounded, jmmediately thrown up their arrns and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey foon induced them to convey hif wounded friend to a neighb0uring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more distur6ed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrancc till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for wbich he had an arder. Lord Ruthven's strength rapldly decreased; in two days mortificotion ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain af he had been of the o6jects about him: bul towards lhe close of the last evenirig, his inirid became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who waf induced to offer his assistance wilh more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heedthe death of my existence as little asthat of lhe passing day; but you may save my horiour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I ncod bvt little—my Iife ebbs apace—I cannol explain the whole—but jf you would conceal all y0u kriow of me, rny honour were free from stain in the world's moulh—and if my death were unknown for s0me time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" criod the dying mon, raisjng himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul revereſ, by all your natvre fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not imparl your knowledgc of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whateuer moy happen, or whatever you may see. \"—Hjs eyes seemed hursting from their sockets: \"I sweclr!\" said Avbrey; he furik laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to reſt, but did not sleep; the rnany circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose vpon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold ſhivering came over him, as if srom the presentimenl of something horrible awaiting bim. Rising earIy in the morning, he was about to enter the hovcl in which he had 1est the corpse, when a robbcr mel him, and insormed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by hirnself and comrades, up0n his retiring, to the pirinacle of a noighbouring mourit, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed lo the first cold ray of the moon thot rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking severcll of the mcn, determined to go and bury it upon tho spot where it lay. But, when he had rnounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clotbes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on whicb lhey had laid lhe body. For a time hls mind was hewildered in conjectures, hut he at last returned, convinced tbatthey had buried the corpse for the sake 0f the clotbes.\nWeary of a oountry in which he bad met with sueh terrible misfortunes, and in wbich all apparently consplred to heighten thot superstitious melancholy that had sei2ed upon his inind, he resolved t0 leave it, and soon arrivcd at Smyrna. While wclitlng for a vessel to convey him lo Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those esfects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst otber things there was a case contairiing seueral weaponf of offence, more or less adapted ta ensuro tbe death of the vlctim. There were several daggers and ataghanf. Whilst tuming them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the samestyle as the dagger discouered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain furthor proof, he fovnd the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovercd tbat it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eycs seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gozing to be bound to the dagger; yet still be wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haftand sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also dropf of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inqulries werc concerning the lady he bad attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthveri's scductive arts. Hor parents were in dlstress, lheir fartune ruined, and she had not been heord of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's rnind became almost broken under so many repeated harrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a viclim to thc destroyer 0f Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and bis only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as lf he were going to save the lifc os some one he held dear. He arrivcd at Calais; a breeze, w hicb seemed obedient to his wiIl, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fatherſ, and there, for a momcrit, appeared to 1oso, in the embraoes and caresses of his ſister, all memory of the past. If she bef0re, by her infantine caresses, had gained his afsection, now that the woman began ta appear, she was still more attaching cls a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not thal winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was nono of that light brilliancy whieh onIy exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue oye was never lit up by tbe levity of tbe mind beneath. There was a melancboly charm ahout it which did not scem to arise from mjsfortune, but from some fceling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not thal light footing, wbich strayf wbere'er a butterfIy or a colour may attract—it was sedate and perisive. When olone, her face was never brjghteried by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—lhat face were then playjng in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians moro fit that her preſentation should be deloyed until her brother's return from the cantinent, wheri he might be her protector. It was now, lherefore, resolued thot tbe next drawing-room, wbich was fast approaching, should be lbe epoch of her cntry into tbe \"busy scenc.\" Aubrey would rather havo remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melaricholy wbich overpawered bim. He could not feel interest about the frivalities of fashionable strangers, when his mirid hadbeen sa torn by the evenls he hod witnossed; but he determined to soeriflce his own comfort lo the protecti0n of his sister. They soon arrived in town, arid prepared sor tbe noxt doy, whicb had been announeed as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessiue—a drclwirig-room had not been held for a long tirne, and all who were onxious to bask in the smjIe of royalty, hastened thither. Aubroy was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himsolf, hoedless of all around him, engclged in the remem brance that the firſt time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized t0o well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your 0ath.\" He had hardly eourage to tvrn, feclrful of seelng a spectre thclt would blast him, when he perceivod, at a little distance, thc same figure which had attracted his notice on this spol upon his first entry into society. He gazed lill his lirnbs alm0st refusing to bear lbeir weight, hc was obliged to lake the arm of a fricnd, and forcing apassoge throvgh the crowd, he tbrew himſelf inlo his carriage, and was driven hame. He paced the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid bis thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circurnstances started up in dreadsul array—the dagger—bis oath.—He roused him-\nself, he cou1d nal believe it p ossible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind wos resting upon. It was impossiblo that it could be real—he determjned, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concernirig Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his ljps, and he could not succeed jn gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near rclation. Leaving her under the proteotion of a matron, he relired into a receſs, arid there gave himself up to his own dovauring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he raused hirnself, and entering another room, foundhis sister surrovnded by several, apparently in earnest conversalion; he attempted to pass clnd get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most a6horred. Hc sprang forward, seized his sister'ſ arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he fovnd himself impeded by the crowd as servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—Ho did not dare to turn, but, hurrying hls sister, soori reached home.\nAubrey becclme almost distracted. If besore his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complotely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monſter's living again presfed upon his thoughts. Hissister's attentions were riow unheeded, and it waſ in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttercd cl few words, and those terrified ber. The moro he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;—was he then to allow thiſ morister to raam, bearing rvin upon his breath, amidst all he held deor, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by bim. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose hiſ suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of empl0ying his own hand to free lhe world from sueh a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his roam, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sclke, to ſvpport nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillnessand solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that imago which haunted him. Hls dress became neglec ted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight damps. He was no loriger lo he recognized; at sirst he returned with the evening to the house; but al last he laid him down to rest wherever fcltigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, einployed people to follow him; but they wore soon distaneed by him who fled from a pursuer swifter thcln any—from thovght.His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into s0ciety, and watch him closely, anxiouf to forewarn, ln spite of his oath, all wborn Lord Ruthven approachod with intimacy. But when he entered lnto a room, hls hclggard and suspicious looks were so strikirig, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was al last obliged ta beg of him to abstclin srom seeking, for her sake, a sociely which afsected him fo strongly. When, bowever, remonstrance proved unavailing, tbe guardians thought propcr to interpose, and, fearing lhat his mind was bocomirig alienated, they thought it high tiine to resumc again that truft whjch had been besore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the irijurieſ and sufferings he had daily oncovntered ln biſ wanderings, and os preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks os what they considerod folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take oonslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible suhject. His incoherence became at last ſo great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wou1d ofton lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had atlained a glassy lustre;—lhe onlysjgn of affcclion arid reoolleclion remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that scverely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do riot touch him—if your love for me is clught, do not go near bim!\" When, however, she lnquired to whom he referred, his only answor was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a ftatc, whence not evcnshe could rouse bim. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became Iess frequent, and his mlnd threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, tbat severol tlmes in the day he wauld covnt upon his fin-\ngers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly olapsed, when, upon the last day of tbe year, one of his guardians enlering his room, bogari to converse with his physician upon the melancholy oircumstance of Aubrey's beirig in so awful o situation, when hif sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Avbrey's attenlian waf attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they fcared he had been deprlved, they mentioned the nameof the Earl af Marsden. Thinking thjs was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avbrey ſeemed pleased, and astonisbed them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at lhe nuptials, and desiring to see his sistor. They answcred not, but in a few minules hiſ sister was with him. He was apparently again capable os being affected by the influence os her lovoly smi1e; for he pressed hcr to his breast, and kiſsed her cheek, wet witb tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being 0nce more cllive to thc feelings of affection. He began to speak with all hls w0nted warmth, and to eangr atulate her upon her marriage with a perfon so distinguishod for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the inonster who had so long insluonced his life. He feized the porlrait in a paroxysm of rclge, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking himwhy he thus destroyed the resemblance of ber future husband, he looked as is he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morister, for be— But he could not advarice—it seemed as if thot voice again bade him remember his oalh—he turned sudden1y round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meclntime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thoughl this was but a return af his disordcr, entered, and forcing him fromMisf Aubrey, desired her t0 leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he hegged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they jinagined had laken possesfion of his mind, ondeavoured to pacify him, and retircd.\nLord Ruthven hadcalled the morning after the drawing-room, and hod heen refused with every one elſe. When be heard of Aubrey's i1l health, he readily undcrstood hirnself lo be the cause of it; but when he leclrned that he was deemed insane, his exultalion and pleasure could hclrdly be conoealed srom those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former compclnion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection forthe brother and interest in his fate, he gradvally won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his pawer? His tongue had dangcrs and toils to recount—could speak of himsolf af of an indlvidual having no sympathy with any heirig on the crowded earth, ſave with her to whom he addresscd himself;—cauld teIl how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preſervation, if it weremerely thot he might listen to her saotbing accents;—jn fine, he knew sa well how to usethe serpent's art, orsuch was the will of fate, that he gained her asfections. Tbe litle of the elder hranch falling at length tohim, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriag e, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the coritinenl.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted t0 bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was givon him; he wrote a letter to his fister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happjness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who once held her in thcir arms as their hope and the hope of thelr h ouse, to delay but for a few hours that marriclge, on which he denounced the inost heavy curses. The servants promised they would delivor it; but givlng it to the physician, be thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passod 0n without rest t0 thebusy inmates 0f tho house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily bc conceiued thari described, the notes of busy preparatian. Morriing came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants cll last overeame their uigjlance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in tbe custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was ovt of the raoin, and in a moment fouridhimself in lhe apartmerit where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was lhe firsl to percoive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by sorce, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and kn0w, if not my brlde to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pusbed him towards bis attendants, who, roused by the oldwoman, had camo in search of him. Aubrey couId no longer support himself; his rage not findlng vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This waf not mentioned to his sisler, who was not present when he entcred, as lhe physician was afraid of agitating her. The morriage was solemnized, ond the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approacb of deoth. He desired his sisler's guardians might be called, and whcri the midnight hour had struck, he relaled oomposedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Misſ Avbrey; bvt when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven hcld disappeared, and Aubrey's sifter had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to ch0ose his place of rest, andProvidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing tbrough the Grecian Archipelclgo, on board one of bis Majesty's vessels, in tbe year 1812, we put inlo tbe harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that naine. The beauty of thls p1ace, ond the certain supply of cattle and vegetables alwoys to be had there, inducemany Brilish vessels to visit it—both men of war ond merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for shjps bound to Smyrna, ils bounties amply repay for the deviation ofa voyage. Wc landed; as usual, at the b0ttom of the bay, and whilst the meri were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the ncltives, the clergyman and myself took a ram6le t0 thccave called Homer's School, and other plaoes, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a smalI monti-\ncule s0 named) we met with and engaged a yourig Greek as our guide, wbo told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engoged me as a pil0t,\" said the Greek, \"and would havc taken me wlth him; but I djd not choose to quit Mitylerie, where I am 1ikely to get marricd. Hewas an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, faeing the river, belongs to him, and he has left ari old man in charge of il: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for il, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not eonstantly; sor he sails in his felucca very often to the different jslands.\"\nThis account exciled our curiosity very mueh, arid we lost no timo in hastenlng to the house where ovr countryman had resided. We werokindly reccived by an old man, who condvcted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance ha1l, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, anda bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-slaincd walls, mclrble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountairi beneath, whioh could be made ta play through the branches by moving cl spring fixed ln the side of asmall bron2e Venus in a leanjng posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall slood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an cmpty book-case:there were n0 mirrorf, rior cl single painting. The hodchamber had merely a large mat tress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton qvllts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greeco. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and paperf, which were then in a large seaman's cbest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think aurselvos justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Sbakspeare'f, B0ileau's, and Rovsseau's w0rkf complele; VoIney's Ruiris os Empires; Ziminerman, in the German language; Klopslock's Messiah; Kolzebue's novelſ; Schiller's plcly of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, anItaliari cditlan, prin ted at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets froin the Greek press at Constantinople, mucb torn, 6ut no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itallan and Latin. The Messiah was literally seribhled all ouer, and ma rked with slips 0f paper, on which also were remarks.\nTbe old man said: \"Tbe lord had been reading these books the euening before he sailed, arid forgot to place them with tbe others; bvt,\" faid he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so porticular, that were I to move 0ne thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is olherways very gaod. I once did him a service; ond I have the praduce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty 2echines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the 1ord broughl here from Adrianople; I don't know for what rcason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleclsjng. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Greclan architeclure,) were considerably higher than lhe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, boneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, asupon them the Greeks pass their evenings in fmokirig, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma cbristi,\" eating sruit, and enjoying the evening hroeze.\nOn the left band as we enlcred the housc, a fmall stroamlet glided awoy, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle 6ushes, a marble seat with an ornainental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, thc 1ord passed many of his cvenlri gs and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wrltjng, and talking to bimself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very deuout, \"arid always ottended our chvrch twice a week, bcsides Sundays.\"\nThe uiew from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye lo Mount Calcla, covered with oliue and myrlle trecs jn bloom, and on the summit of which ari ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A srnall stream issuing frorn the ruins doseended in broken cascades, until il waslost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, arid an borizon unshadowed by a fingle cloud, tormjnates the view in fronl; and a little on tbe left, throvgh a vifto of lofty chesriut and palin-trees, several small islarids wore distinctly obferved, sludding the light blue wave with spots af emerald green. I soldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the namo of the pcrson whohad resided in this r0mantic solitude: none knew his naine but Domirilck, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am fure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not tiine to visit lheArmenian, but on 0ur return to the towri we lcornt several parliculars of the isolated lord. He hod portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with thcmat thenuptiol feast. He gclve a cow to one man, harses to others, ond cotton and silk to lhe girls who liveby woaving these artieles. He also bought a new boal for a fisherman who had lost bis own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the p0ar children. In short, he appeoredto us, from all we coIlected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One ciroumstance we leclrnt, which our old friend at the c0ttage tbought proper not to disclose. He had a most beauliful daughter, with whom the lord was oflen seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a plano-forte, and taught her himsclf the use of it.\nSuch was tbe information with whieh we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this ramhler in Greece could bc. He had money it wcls evident: he had philanthropy of disposilion, and all lhose eccentricities which mark peeuliar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dovbtswere dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travellirig in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about wbom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; Imet him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, arid I also visiled him at Mitylene.\" We had never lhen heard of his lordship's fame, as we hod been some years frorn home; hut \"Childe Harolde\" beirig put into our hands wc recogriized tbe recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious iri our researches clt the cottage, but we c0nſaled ourfelves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day wiIl nevcr return. I make thjs statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been defcribed as os an unfeoling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributirig in anyway to sooth lts sorrows, or add lo its pleasures. The fact is direetly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered frorn these li tlle anecdotes. All the finer feelingf of the heclrt, so elogantly depicted iri his lordship's poems, seem to have thelr seat in his bosom. Tendorness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide oll hjs actions: and his courting the repase of solitude is an additional reason for rnarking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read tbe preceding plcasing \"traits\" without feeling pro ud of him as a cauntryman. Withrespect to his loves or plcasurcs, I do not assume o right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed ogainst man's moral integrity; and he wbo dares juftify himfelf before that owfvl triburialwhere all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-morlal. Lord Byron's characteris worthy os his genius. To d0 good in secrel, and shun the world's appIauſe, is the furest testimony of a virtuous hoart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGi1let, Printer, Crown-court, Fleot-street.",

In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\""

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE fuperstition vpon which this tale is fovnded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to 6e common: it did not, however, oxtend itself to the Greeks until aster the establishment of Christianity; and it has anly assumed its present form since thc diuision of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, lhat a Latin bodycould not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increafod, arid formed tbe subject of many wondersul staries, still extant, of tho dead rjsing from their gravef, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, aIl ovor Hungary, Po1and, Austrla, and Lorraine, where the beljef existed, thatvampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of lhe bl ood of their victims, who became cmaciated, lost their strengtb, arid speedily died of oansumptions; whilst these human blood-suckersfclttenod—and their veins becamo distendcd to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to fl0w fr0rn all the passages of their bodies, and even from the vcrypores of thoir skins.\nIri the London Journal, of Mclrch, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account af a particular case af vampyrism, which is ftated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrales af the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of lhe Turkiſh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himselfof tho evil, by eating some of tho earth out of the vompyre's grave, and rubbing hjmself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevcnt him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, abovt twenty or thirty days after his death and buricll, many perſons complained af having been tormented by him, arid a depositjon was made, that fovr pcrsons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To provent further inischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is svpposed to be usual iri cafes of vampyrism) sresb, clnd entirely free fromcorruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid bload. Proof having been thus obtained, tbey resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was d riven entire1y through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reportod to have cried out as drccldfully as if he had been alivc. This done, they cut off hishead, burned his body, and threw the asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses os those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survivod them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person suckedby a vampyre becomes a vampyre himseIf, and sucks in his tvrn.\nCbies bailiff.\nThis m0nstrous rodomon tade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of thepresent observations than any olher instance whi ch could be adduced. In many parts ofGreoce it is considered as a sort of punifhment after death, for some heinous crime committed whiIst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confjne his infernal visitations solely to those bejngs he lovcd most while upon eartb—those to whom he was bound by tjes of kindred arid affection.—A fupposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut firſt on oarth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of a1l thy race; There from lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yel loathe the hanquet which perforce Must feed thy livid llving corse, Thy viotims, ere they yet expirc, Shall know the demon for lheir sire; As cursing thee, lhou cursing tbem, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The yourigest, best beloved of all, ShaIl bless thee with a father's nclme— Thal word shclll wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou muft end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tirige—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifoless blue; Then with unhallowed hand sball tear The tresſes of her yellow hair, 0f which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest plcdge was worn— But now is horne away by thee Memorial of thirie agony! Yel with thine own beſt blood shall drip; Tby gnashing tooth, and hclg-\ngard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrlts ravc, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accurſed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful paein of \"Tbalaba,\" the vclmpyre corse of the Arabian mclid Orieiza, wbo is represented as having roturned from the grave for lhe purp0se of tormenting him she 6est loved whilst in existence. But this oannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulncss of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole 0f the tale as a complete type of purity and inriocence. The veracious Taurnesort gives a 1ong account in his lravels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in hjsgreat work upan thls subject, besides a variety 0f anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put farth some learnod diſsertations, tending to prove it to be o olassical, as well as barbariari error.\nMany cvrious and interesting natices on thls singularly horrible superstition migbt be added; though thc present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necossorily devoted to explanatian, and which may now be coricluded by merely remarking, that th0ugh the term Vampyre is the one in mosl general acceptation, lhere are feveral others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucol0cha, Vardoulacha, G0ul, BrovcoI0ka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeried that in the midst of the dissipations attcndant upon a Loridon winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemon, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attenlion, that he migbt by a look quell it, and throw fear int0 those breasts where thoughtlessncss reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whencc it arose: some attri6ulcd it to the dead grey oye, which, fixing vpon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, ond at one glance lo pierce through ta the inward workings of the heart; bvl feIl upon the cheek with o leaden ray that weigbed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculia ritles caused hiin to be invited lo every house; cll1 wished to see him, and those who had been aceustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable ofengaging their attention. In spite of the deadly huc of his face, which never gclined a warmer tint, eitber frorn the blufh of modesty, or from the strong emotion ofpassiori, though its form and outline were beautifuI, many of the female huntcrs after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some rnarks of wbat they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had 6een the mockery of every monster shewri in drawing-rooms since her marriage, lhrew horself in hif way, and did alI but put on the dress of a mauntebarik, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were appclrently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—everi her unappalled impudencc was baffled, and shc left the fiold. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidarice of his eycſ, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, h0wever, the reputatjon of a winning torigve; and whether il was that it even overcame lhe droad of his singular characler, or thot they wcre moved by his opparent hatred os vice, he was as osten among those females who forin the boast af their sex from their domestic virtues, as among tbose who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a yovng gentleman of the name of Avbrey: he was an orphari left with cln only sister jn the possession of grcatwealth, 6y parenls who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought il tbeir duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the eare of mercenary subalter ns, he cultjvated more his imagination tban his judgmont. He had, herice, thal high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He belicved all to sympathise wilh vlrtue, and thought that vice was lhrowri in by Provjdence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misory of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clotheſ, whioh were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fino, that the dreams of poets were the realities af life. He was handsomo, frank, and rich: sor these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striulng which should describe with least truth tbeir languishing or romping favourites: the daughtersat the same time, by their brightening countenances when he clpproached, and by their sporkling eyes, whcn he opened his lips, soon led him into falſo notions of his talents and his merit. Atlached as he wcls to the romance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, exoept in tbe tallow and wax candles that flickered, not fromthe presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundatlon in real life f0r any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriplions contained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, ho was abovt to relinquisb his dreams, wben tbe extraordinary being we have above described, crossed hiin in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an jdea of thc character of cl man entire1y absorbed iri hiinself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avaidance of lheir c0ntact: allowing his imaginalion to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to exlravaganl ideas, he soon farmod this object into the hero of a romarice, and determined to obferve the offspring of his fancy, rather lhan the perſon before him. He hecame aoquainled with him, paid him attentions, clnd so far advanced upon hif notlce, that his presonce was cllways recognised. He grodually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarraſsed, and so0n found, from the riotes of preparatlon in — Stroet, that he was about to travel. Desjrous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he binted to hisguardians, that it was tiine for him to persorm the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary t0 enable the young to take some rapid steps iri lhe career of vice towards puttirig themseIves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appeor af if fallen from the ſkies, whenever fcandal0us intrigues are mentioned as the ſubjects of pleasantry or ofpraiſe, accordlng to lhe degree os skill shewn in carrying them 0n. Theyconsented: and Aubroy jmmediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rutbven, was surprised to receive from him a proposol to join him. Flattered by sucb a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other mon, he gladly accepted it, and in afew dayf they had passed the circ1ing walers.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportvnity of studying Lord Ruthveri's charocter, and now he fovnd, that, though many more of hif actions were cxposed to his view, lhe results offered different oonclusions from the apparent molives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his libera1ity;—the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from bis hand more than enovgh lo relieve their immediate wants. But Au6rey could not avoid remarking, that jt was not upon the virtuous,reduced to iridigence by the misfortunes attendont even upon virlue, lhat he bestowed his alms;—these were sent srom the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but wben tho profligato came to ask something,not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him slill deoper in bis iniquity, he wcls sentaway with rich charlty. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunily of the vicious, which generally preuails over the retiring bafhsulness of the virtuous indigent. Therc was one circumstance aboul thc charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon wbom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the 1owest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and olber towns through which they passed, Au6rey was surprized at the apparent eagerness wilh whjeh his oompanion soughl for lhe centr eſ of alI fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging facc, with which he generally walched tbe s0ciety around: itwas not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luokless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractednesſ of mind was laid aſide, and his eyes spark1ed with m0rc fire than that 0f the cat wbilst dallying with lhe half-dead mouse. In every town, he left tho formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, tbe fate that hod drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, wilhout a single farthing os his late immonse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satlsfy their present craving. Yet he took no money fr0m the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the rujner of many, tbe last gilder he had justsnatchcd from the convulsive grasp of theinnocent: this might but bc the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capclble os coinbclting thecunning of lhe more experienced. Aubrey often wished to ropresent lhis to his friend, and beg him to reſignthat chority and pleasure wbich proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed jt—for eacb day he hoped bis friend would give him some opportunity os ſpeaking fra nkIy and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven iri his carriage, and amidst tbe various wild and rleh scenes of nalure, was always the sclme: bis eye spoke less than his lip; and though Avbrey was near the objoct of his curiosity, be obtained no grealor gratislcation from it than the conftant excitement of vainly wishjng to broak that myſtery, which to his exalled jmagination began to assume tbe appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time laſt sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendclnce upori the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he werit in search of the mernorlals of ariother almost deserted city. Whjlst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from Engla nd, wbich he operiedwith eager impatience; the first waf from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if lt had bcfore entered into his imaginotjon that there was an evil power resident in bis companion, thefo seemed to give hlm svfficient reason for the belief. His gvardians inslstcd upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadsully vicious, for that the passeſsion of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangeraus to sociely. Il had been discavered, that his contempt for the adultress had riot originated in hatred of her choracter; 6vt that hc hod required, to enhaneo hif gratlfication, that his victirn, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle os unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradotion: in fine, that all those fema1es whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had,finco his deparlure, throwri even the mask aside, and had not scrup led to expose the whole deformity0f their vices to the public gclze.\nAubrey determined upon leavirig one, whose characler bad not yel shown a single bright poirit on which lo rest the eye. He res0lved lo invent ſomc plausible prelext for a6andonlng hjm altogether, purposing, in the meon wbile, to watch him more closc1y, and to let na slight circumstclnces pass by unnoticed. He entered inlo the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeovouring to work upon the inexpcrienee os the daughter of the lady whose house hc chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; be was therefore obliged to earry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignati on had been clppoirited, which would most Iikely end in the ruin of an jnnoccnl, though thoughtless girl. Losing rio time, he entered lhe apartrnent of Lord Ruthven, arid abruptly asked him his intentions witb respect to the lady, insorming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her thot very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were svch as he supposed all would havc upon such an occasion; and upon 6eing pressed whelher he jntended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a riote, to say, that fr0m that moment he must decline acoompanying his Lordship in the remainder af their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother af the lady, informed hor of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was preverited. Lord Ruthven noxt day meroly sent his servant ta notify his complete assent ta a separation; but dld not hinl ariy suspicion of his plans hclving beeri foiled by Au6rey's interposition.\nHaving lefl Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soori found himself at Athens. Ho tben fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soan occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slavef, had hidden themfelucs beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same raof as himself, existed a being, so beautifvl and delicate, that fhe might have formed the mode1 sor a painter wishlng to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet'ſ paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could be1ong to those who had no souls. As shc danced upon the plain, or lripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelIe a poar type of her beauties; for who would have exchonged her eye, opparently the eye of animaled nature, f0r that sleepy luxurious 1ook of the animal suited but to the tasto of an epicuro. The light slep of Ianthc osten aecompanied Aubrey in his search after ontiquities, and often would the uneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere 6utterfly, show the wh0le beauty of her form, floating as it were upon tbe wind, to lhe eager gaze of him, wbo forgot the letters he had just decyphercd uponan almost effaced tclblet, in the contemplatlon of her sylph-like figure. Osten would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhihit in the sun's ray such delicately brllliant and swiftly fading hues, it might wellexeuse the forgetfulness os the antiquary, who let escape from his inirid the very objecthe had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to descrjbe ehclrms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—Il was innocerice, youth, and beauty, vnaffected hy crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve cl memorial for his future h ours, she wovld stand by, and watch the magic efsects of bis pencil, in tracing the scenes of her nativc place; she would then describe to him tbe circIing danee upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all theglowing coIours of youthful memory, lhe m arriage p0mp sho remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turriing ta subjects that bad ovidently made o groater impression upon her mind, would tell him al1 the supernatural tales of her nurse. Hcr earnestncss and apparcnt bclief of wbat she narrated, excited the interest evenof Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, wh0 had passed years amidsl his friendf, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the ljfe of a laveIy female to prolonghis existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attemptcd to laugh her out of sucb idle and horrihle santasies; but Ianthe cited to him tbe names af old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after ſeveral of their near relalives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the siend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged thein, with griefand heartbreaking, lo confess it was true. Sho detailed to him the traditional appearance af tbese monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, h0wever, stiIl perfifted in persuading her, thclt there covld be no truth in her fears, though ot the ſame time he wondered at the many coincidences which had alI tended to excite a belief in the svpernatural power of Lord Rvthvcn.\nAubrey began to attacb himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virt-\nues of the women ainong wbom he had sought f0r his vision of romance, won his heart; and wbile he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an unedvcated Greek gjrI, still he found himself more and more attaohed to the almost fairy sorm before him. He would tear himself at times from her, arid, sorming a plan for sorne antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return unti1 his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to six his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst iri his mind he retained an image that seemed alono the rightful possefsor of histhoughls. Iclnthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the ſame frank infantile bcing he hod first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer ony one with whom she could visit her fauourite haunls, whllst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering ſome fragment whieh had yet escaped the destrvctive hand os time. She had appcaled to her parents on the svbjeot of Vampyres, and lhey both, with several present, affirmed their existencc, pale with horror at the very name. Soon afler, Aubrey determined to proceed upan one of his excursions, which was to detain hlm for a few h0urs; when thoy heard the nclme os tbe place, thcy all at onee begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily poſs tbrough a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had cIosed, upon any consideralion. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upori him who dclred to cross thejr path. Aubrey inade lighl of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; bul when he sow them shudder at hiſ daring thus to mock a superior, irifernal power, tbo very name of whjch apporeritly made their blood freeze, he was silenl.\nNext morning Aubrey set osf upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that hls words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had insplred them with such terror. When he wasabout to depart, Ianthe came to the fide of his horse, ond earnestly beggcd of him to returri, ere night alIowed the power of these boings lo be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he dld not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spccks which, in the warrner climates, so rapidly galher into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upori the devotod country.—He at last, however, mounted his horfe, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fets, night begins: and cre he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the eanopying faliage, whilst the blue forked lightnirig seomed to fall and radiate at his very seet. Suddenlyhls horfo took fright, and he was carried with dreadfuI ropidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the g1are of lightning, that he was in tbe neighbourhood of a hovel tbat hordly liftod itself up from tbe masses of dead leaves clnd brushwood which surrourided it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping ta find ſome one to guide him to tbe town, or at loast trusling to obtain she1ter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, allowed him t0hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman minglirig with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in ane almost unbroken sovnd;—he wos start led: but, roused by the thunder which again roIled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the doar of the hut. He found himsels in utter darkneſs: the sovnd, however, guided him. He was apparently unpcrceived; for, though he oalled, still the sounds continued, and no notioe was taken of him. He found himse1f ln conlact with some one, wbom he immedjately sejzed; when a v0ice crled, \"Aga in baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt hjmse1f grappled by one wh0se strength seemed superhvman: determined to sell his lifeas dearlyaſ he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled wilh enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling vpon his breast, had placed hishands upon his throat—when the gloreof many torches penetrclting throvgh the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the bronches, as he brakethrough thc wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; ond Aubrey, incopable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the lighl of their torohes fell upori the mud walls,and the thatchloclded on cvery indivjdual straw wjth heavy flakes of ſoot. At the desire of Aubrey they seclrched for her who had altract ed him by hor cries; he wcls again left in darkness; bvl whal was his horror, when the light of lhe torohes once more burst upori him, to perceivc the airy form of his fair conductress broughl in a lifeless corſo. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vifion arising from his disturbed imagiriation; but he agairi saw the same form, wheri he unclosedthem, strelched by his side. There was no eolour upon her cheek, riot even upon her lip; yel there was a stillnesſ about ber face that seemed almost as attacbing as the lise that once dwelt there:—upori her neek arid breast was blood, and upon hor throat were the marks of teeth having openod the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously strvek with borror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickly sormed, clrid Aubrey was lclid by the slde of her wbo had lately been ta him tbe obieet of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life tbat had died within her. He knew n0t wbat hls thoughtſ werc—his mind was benum6ed and seemed to shun roflection, and take r efuge in vacancy—he held alinost unconsciously iri hjs hand a nakcd dagger of a particular construction, whicb had been found in the hvt. They were soon met by difserent parties who had been engaged jn the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lainentclblc cries, as they approachedthe city, forewarned the pclrenls of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe thelrgrief wovld 6e impossible; but when thcy ascortainedthe causo of thejr child's death, thoy looked at Aubrey, and pointed to tbe corse. They were inconsolabIe; botb died broken-bearted.\nAubrey being put to bod was seized with a most vlolont fever, and was often delirious; in thcse intervals he wauld call upon Lord Ruthuen and upon Iantbe—by some unaccountable com6ination he seemed to beg of his former companiori to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upan his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthuen, chanced at this tlme to arrive ot Athens, and, from whatevcr motive, upon bearlng of tho state of Aubrey,immediately placcd himself in the same havse, and became his constant atleridant. When the latler recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now oombined with that of a Vainpyre; but Lard Rulhueri, by bls kind words, jmplying almost rcperitance for the favlt that had oaufed thoir separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care whieh he showed, soon reconciled him to bis presence. His lordship seemed qulte ohclnged; he no loriger appeared that apathetic bcing who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began lo be rapid, be again gradually retired irito the same state of mind, and Avbrey perceived no difference from the former mcln, except that at times he was surprised to inecl his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he kriew not why, but this smile haunled him. During the last stage of the invalid'ſ recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparent ly engaged in watchlng the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of lhose orbs, circllng, like our world, the moveless suri;—indeed, he appeared to wifh to avoid the eyes of all.\nAuhrey's mind, by this shoek, was much weakened, arid lhat elasticity of spiril which had once so distingujshed him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of soliludc and silence as Lord Ruthven; butmuch as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find lt in lhe neighbourhood of Athens; if he soughtil amidst the ruins ho had formcrly frequented, Ianthc's forin stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quesl of the modest violet; tben suddenly turning round, would s how, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bilter assaciations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rutbven, to whom he held himself bound by lhe tender care he had taken of him durlng his illriess, tbot they should visit lhose parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollecti0n couldbo atlached: but though they thus hastened fr0m place to place, yet they seemed not to hoed what they gazed upon. They heard rnuch of r0bbers, but they gradually began to sIight these rep0rts, which they imagined were onIy the inveriti0n of lndividuals, whoſe interest it was to excite the generosity of those wh0m they defended frorn pretendeddangers. In consequence of thus negIecting the advice of the inhabltants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, inore to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon cntering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a tarrent, with large masses of rock brought d0wn from the neigbbouring precipices, they had reafon to repent thejr negIigence; for scaroely were the whole of tbe party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to tbeir heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an inslant tbeir guards had left them, and, placingtbemselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report camc. Lord Ruthvon and Aubrey, imitating thoir example, relired for cl momenl behind the sheltering turn of lhe defile: but afhamed of being thus detainod by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unrosisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and toke them in the rear, they determined at 0nce to rush forward in search of tho cnomy. Hardly had they lost tbe shelter ofthe rock, wben Lord Ruthven recoived a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grovnd. Aubrey hastened to his assiftance; and, no longer heeding lhe contcstor his own poril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards havlrig, upon Lord Ruthven's being waunded, immediately throwri up thejr arms and furrendered.\nBy promises of grcat reward, Avbrey soan induced them to canvey his wounded friend to a neighbovring cabin; and having clgreed upon a ransom, be was no more disturbed by their preſence—they being content merely la guard the entrance till their comrade should return with tbe promised sum, far which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strerigth rapidly decreased; in two days mortificcllion ensued, arid death seemed advancirig with hasty steps. His oonduct and appoaranco had not changed; he seerned as unconsciaus of pain as he had been of the objocts about him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mind became apparently uneasy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inducod to offer his assistance wilh more lhan usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more thari that—I mean not iny lise, I heed the death of my existence as little as thclt of tbe passing day; but yov may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do ariy thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I noed but little—iny life ebbs apclce—I cannot explain the whole—but if you wou1d conceal all you know os me, myhonour were frec from stain iri the world'ſ mouth—and if my death were unknown far some time in Englclnd—I—I—but life.\"—\"Il shall n0t be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying mcln, raising hlmse1f with exvltant vioIence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by oll your nature feclrs, fwear that, for a year arid a day you will not impart your knowledgo of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatover may hclppen, or whateuer you may see. \"—His eyes seemed burstirig from their sockcts: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with thjs man rose upon hif mjnd, and be knew not why; when be remcmbered his oalh a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment os something horrible awaiting him. Rising e arly in tbe mornlng, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had lefl the corpse, when a robber met him,and informod him that it was no longer thero, hovirig been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mounl, according to a promise lhey had givcn his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first c0ld ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury il upon tbe spot where it lay. But, when he had movnted to the summit hc found na trace of either the corpse ortho clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identiccll rock on which they bad laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relurried, convinced that they had buried the corpse for lbe sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country ln which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighteri that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he res0lved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting f0r a vessel to coriuey hiin to Olranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those efsects be had with him belonging t0 Lord Ruthven. Amongst 0ther things thore was a case containing feveral weapons of offence, more or lcss adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several doggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, ond exclmining thelr curious forms, what was his surprisc at sinding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the sarne sty1e as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and hls horror may be imagined when he discovered tbat it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, tho sheath hc he1d iri his hond. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to bc bound to the dagger; yel still he wished lo disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were olike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on hls wcly homo, at Rome, bis first inquiries were concerning tbe lady he had attcrnpted to snatch from Lord Ruthuen's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, thejr f0rlune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind beeame almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that tbis Iady hadsallen a victim to the deſtr0ycr of Ianthe.He became inorose and silent; and his only occupation consifted in urging the speed af the postllions, as if he were going to save the lise of some one he held deor. He arrivcd al Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient lo his will, soori wafted him to the Eng1ish shores; and he hastened to lhe mansion os his fathers, arid there, for a momenl, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was stjll more attaching cls a oompanion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gainf thegaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was nono of that light hrilliancy which only exists ln the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye wasnever lit up by the leuity of the mind beneath. Tbere was a melancholy charm about it whjch did not seem to arise from misfortune, but srom some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfIy ora oolour may attrclct—it waſ sedate and pensive. Wheri alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forgel those griefs shc kncw deslroyed his rest, who would hclve exchanged hor smile for tbat of tbeuoluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—thot face were then playing in the llght of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat bcen presented to the world, it having bcen thought by her guardians more flt that her presentation should be delayed until her brather's returnfrom tbe contlnent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was saſt approaching, should be the epoch of ber e ntry into the \"busy fcene.\" Aub rey would ratherhave remained iri the mansion of his fathers, ond sed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not foel interest about the frivalitieſ of fashionable strangers, when hls mind had been so torn by the everits he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comsort to the protectiori of his sister. Tbey soon arrived iri town, and prepared for the noxt day, whlch had been announced as a drawing-room.\nTho crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been beld for a long time, and all wbo were onxious to bask in the smi1e os royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was flanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in thc remembrance that tbe first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly ſeizcd by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, ſounded iri his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a ſpectre thal would blast him, when he perceived, at o 1ittle distance, the same figure which had attracted his natice on this spot upon his first entry into society. Ho gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bcar their weight, he was obliged to take tbe arm of a friend, and forcing a pclssage lhrough the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paccd the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his bands upon his head, as if he were asrajd his tboughts were burstlng from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances s tarted up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He rouscd himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise agajn!—He thought his iinaginatiori bad conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it eould be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though ho altempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the nome hung upori his lips, and hc couId not svcceed in gaining insormation. He went a few nights after with his sister lo tbc assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired jnto a recess, and there gave himself up to bis own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were Ieaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found hjs sister surrounded by seueral, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, wben one, whom he requeſted to moue, turned round, and reveoled to him thofc features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sifler's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the slreet: at tbe door he found himself impeded by the crowd af servants who were waiting for their lordſ; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard tbat voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reaehed home.\nAubrey bccaine almost distracted. Is before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much m0re c0mplctely was it engrossed, now that the certainly af the monster's living again presscd upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions wcre n0w unheeded, and it was in vain that ſhe intreatod him to explcliri to her what had caused his abrupt conduct.He only uttcred a few words, arid those tcrrified her. The inore he tboughl, the inore be was bewildered. His oath startled him;—was he then to allow this morister to roam, 6earirig ruin upon his b roalh, amidst all he heId dear, and not avert itſ progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath,and diſclose his suspicjons, who would believe him? He thought of einploying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been alreody mocked. For days he remairied in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one,and ate only when his fister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature.At last, no longer capable of bearing sti1lness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious lo fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wanderod, as often exposed to the no0n-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; bvt at last he laid him dawn la rcſt wherever fatigueovertook him. His sjster, anxious for his fafety, empIoyed pe0ple to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from o pursuer swifter than any—from thoughl. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his obsence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend omongst them, of whose presence they were unoonscious, he determined to enter again irito society, and watch him clos ely, anxious to forewarn, in spite os his ooth, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious lookf were so striking, hls inward shudderings so visible, thal his sister wos at last obIiged to beg of him to abstain from seekjng, for her fako, a socjety which affected him so strongly.When, however, remoristranee pr0ved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpoſe, and, fearing thclt his mind was becoming alieriated, they thought it high tiine to resume again that trust wbich had been before imposed upon themby Aubrey'f parents.\nDesirous os faving him from the injuries clnd sufferings he had daily oncountered in his wandorings, and of preventing birn from exposing t0the general eye those marks of what they considered foIly, they engoged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of hlm. Hc hclrdly appeared to notice it, so comp1etely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that ho was confined to his chamber. Thcre he w0uld oftenlie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emacioted, his eyes had attained a glossy 1ustre;—the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself vpon the entry of hif sister; then he would sometimes start, and, selzing her hands, with looks that severely affIicted her, he w ould dcsire ber not lo toucb him. \"Ob, do not touch him—if your 1ove for me is aught, do nol go riear him!\" When, howover, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answcrwas, \"True! true!\" and clgain he sank into a state, whence not even fhe could roufe him. Tbis lasted many monthf: gradualIy, however, aſ the year wos passing, his incoherences beoamc less frequent, and his mind threw osf a portionof ils glooin, whjlst his guardlansobserved, thal several times iri the day he would count upon his fingers a definite num6er, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians cntering his raom, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circuinstance of Aubrey's being ln so awfvl a situation, wheri his sister was going next day to be married.Instantly Aubrey's attention was atlracted; hc asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name af the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thjs wos a young Earl whom be had met with in society, Aubrey seeined pleased, and astonished lhem still more by his expressing hjs intention to he prefent at the nuplials, arid desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was witb him. He was apparcnt1y again capable of being affected by the influence of her lavely smile; for he pressed her to hjs breast, and kissed her cheek, wet witb toars, flowing at the thought of her brother's being orice more alive ta the feelings of affection. He began to speak wilh aIl his wonted warmlh, ond to congratulate hor upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rankand every a eoompljshrnent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what wos his surprjse al beholding the features os the monster who bad solong influenced his 1ife. He ſeized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramplod it under fool. Upon her asklng him why he thus destroyed tbercsemblance of her future hushand, he looked as is he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, clnd gazing on ber with a frantic exprcssion of countenance, he bade her swear thclt she would never wed this monstor, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the mearitime the guardiaris and physician,who had hoard the whole, and thought this was but o return os his disorder, entered, and sorcing him from Miss Aubrey, deſired her to leave him. He fell uponhis knees to them, he imp1ored,he begged of them to delay but forone day. They, attributlng this lo the insanity they imagined had taken possessiori of his mind, endeavovred to pacisy him, clnd retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-ro0m, and had been refused with every one else. Wben he heard of Aubrey's ill hoalth, he readily understood himself to be tbe cause of il; but when he lea-\nrned that he was deemed lnsane, his exultatiori and pIeosure could hardly be conceoled fram those am0ng whom he had gajried this information. He hasteried to tho housc of his former companion, and, by constanl attendance, and tbe pretcnce of great affeclion for tbe brother and interest in hisfate, hc gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangors and toils to rocount—could speak of himself as of on individual having no sympathy with any being on the crawded earth, save with her towhom he add ressed himself;—oould tell how, since he knew her, his existence, hadbeguri to seem worthy of prcservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accenls;—in flne, he knew sowell how to vse the ferpent's art, orsuch was the will af sate, that he gained her affections. The title of the eldor branch falling at length to hjm, he oblained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marrjage, (in spito of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continenl.\nAubrcy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, eonjuring her, as she valued herown happiness, herown honour, and the honour of those now in lhe grove, who onco held her in their arms as thelr hope arid tbe hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced thc most heavy curses. The servclnts promised thoy would deliver it; bul giving it lo the physician, he thought it bctter not to harass any more lhe mind of Miss Aubrey by, whot he consldered, tbe ravjngs os o maniac. Night passedon without resl to the busy jnmates of the houſe; and Aubreyheard, with o horror that mcly more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparotion. Morning came, and the sound of carriages br0ko vpon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantjc. The curiosity of the servants at last overoame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving himin the custady of an belpless old woman. Hc ſeized the opporlunity, with one baund was oul of the room, and in a rnomcnt found himself in the aportment where all were riearIy assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, ond, taklng hls arm by force, hurried bim from the room, speechless wilh rage. Wheri on the staircase, Lord Ruthveri whispered iri his ear—\"Remember your oath, arid knaw, if not my bride to day, your siſter is dishonoured. Worneri arc frail!\" Sa saying, he pvshed him towards hjs attendants, who, roused by the old womon, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; hisrage riot finding venl, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed.This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not prescnt when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The mclrriage was salemnized, ond the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAvbrey's weakriess increased; the effusionof blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desirod his sister's guardiaris might he calIed, and when the inidnight hour had strvck, herelated composedly what the reador has perused—he died immediately afler.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too 1ate. Lord Ruthven had disappeared,and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEX TRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before hirn, where to choosc bis place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the G recian Archipclago, on board 0ne of hisMajesty's vessels, in the year 181z, we put into the harhour of Milylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, ond the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vefsels to visit it—both rnen of war and merchantmen; arid though jt lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; af usual, at the bottom 0s the bay, and whilst the men were employed in walering, and the purser bargaining for cattle wllh the ncllives, the cIergymclnarid myself took a ramble to the cave called H0mer's School, arid other plaoes, where we had 6een before. On thc brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and erigaged a young Greek as our guide, who t0ld us he had come from Scio witb an Engllsh lord, who left lhe island four days prevlous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"clnd would bave taken me with him; bvt I did riol choose ta quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good rnan. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, andhe has left an old man incharge of it: he gaue Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided thero obout fourteen months, though not constantly; f0r he sails in his felvcca very often to the djfferent is1ands.\"\nThis aceount excited our ouriosity very much, and we loſt no tjme in hastenirig to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly rece ived by an oId man, wh0 conducted us over the monsion. It consjsted of sour apartments on the grourid-fIoor—ari entrance hall, a drawing-roorn, o sitting parlour, and cl bed-room, with a spocious clofet annexed. They were aIl sirnply decorated: plairi green-stained waIls, marble tab1es ori either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fouritain beneath, which cauld be made to p1ay through the branchef by moving a spring fixed in the side of a sinaIl hronze Venus in a leaning poftvre; a large couch or sofa completed lhe furniture. In the hal1 stood hals cl dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The 6edchamber bad merely a large mattress spreod on thc fl oor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—lhe common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble reccss, sorinerly, the old man told us, filled with books and popers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the cl0sel: it was open, but we did not think oursclves justified in examinjng the contentf. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltclire's, Shakspeare's, BoiIeau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins os Empires; Zimmerman, in the Gcrman language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's nouels; Schjller's plcly os thc Robhers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editlon, printed at Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphletf from lhe Greek press at Conslantinople, much lorn, but no Eng1ish book of any doscription. Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itallan and Latiri. The Mefslah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of pclper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The l0rd had been reading tbese books the evening before he sailed, clnd forgot to place them with thc others; bvt,\" said he, \"there thcy must lie until his retvrn; for he is so particular,that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; be isotherways very good. I once did him a service; and I bave the produce of this farm for the troubIe of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a smclll cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought hcre from Adrianople; I don't know for what roas0n.\"\nThc appearance of the house externcllly was pleasing. The partico in frorit wasfifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrourided by a lig ht ſtorie bcllustrade, was covered by a flne Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houso-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wlries, such cls \"laohryma christi,\" eoting fruit, and enjoying thc evening breeze.\nOn the lefl hand as we entered tho house, a small strcamlet gIided away, grapes, oranges and limef were clusteririg together on its borders, and vnder thc shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with ari arnamenta1 wooderi back was p1aced, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nightſ till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"Isuppose,\" said lhe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twiee a woek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seal was what maybe termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A lirie of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cavered with olive and myrt le trees in bloom, clnd on the summit of whioh ari ancienl Greek temple appoared iri majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended ln broken caſcades, until jt was lost in lhe woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and ari horizon urishadowed by a slngle cloud, termincltes the view in frorit; and a little on tho left, through cl vista of lofty chesnut and polm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding tbe light blue wave with spotſ of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more thanI did thiſ; butour enquiries were fr uitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantlc solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wbo hod gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our c0nductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will nal,\"—\"And canriot yov tell, old frie-\nnd?\" sclid I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare riot.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we leomt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when ho was last vpon lhe island, and evcn danccd with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to orie man, horſes to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who Iive byweaving thefe articles. He a1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gaue Greek Testamcnts to the poor children. In ſhort, he appeared to us, from alI wo collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent cbaracter. One circuinstance we leamt, which 0ur old friend at the cottage lhoughl proper not to disclose. He hod a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was aften seen walking on the sea-fhore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the inf0rmation with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; 0ur imaginationsall on the rac k, guessing who this rambler in Greece oould be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of diſposition, and all those eccentricitieſ which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, clll aur doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FDSTER, the architect, a pupiI of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individua1,\" said he, \"about whom you are sa anxiovs, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travcls ontho is1and of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never thon heard of his lordship's fame, as wo had been some years fr0m home; but \"Childe Harolde\" beirig put into our hands we rocognized the reeluse af Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been inore curious in our reſearches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with tho idea of returning to Mitylenc ori some future day; but to ine that day will never return. I make this statement, believirig lt not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his 1ordshjp's good nclmc, which has been grassly slandored. He has been described as ofan vnfeeling disposltion, averse lo associating witb human nature, or eontributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasuros. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plclinly gathcred from these litlle anecdotes. All the siner feelirigs of tbe heart, so elegclntly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo hclve their seat in his bosom. Tende-\nrnoss, sympathy, and cbarity appear to guide all bisactjons: and his courting lhe rcpose of solitude iſ an additional reason for marking bim as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose heod Benevolence hath thro wn her inant-\nle. No man can read the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of bim as a countryman. Wilb respect to hls loves or p1easures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be recei ved with coutiori, partjcularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsels before that awfuI tribunaI where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lard Byron's choracler is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the wo rld's applause, is tbe surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-opproving conscience.\nTHE END\nGi1Iet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-strcet.",

But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale ls founded is very goneral in the Eost. Amang the Arabians it appears ta be comrnon: il did not, however, extend itself lo the Greeks vntil after tho establishment of Christianity; and it has only clssumed its preſenl form since the divlsion of the Latin arid Greck churches; at which time, the idca becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forrned the subject of mariy wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the bIood of lhe young and beautjful. In tho West it spread, with some slight variati0n, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, clnd Lorraine, where the bellef existed, that vampyreſ nightly imbibed a certain portiori of the blood of their viclims, who became emaciated, lost their strongth, and speediIy died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckerſ fattened—and their veins became disterided to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodles, and euen from the very porcſ of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is o curious, and,of covrse, credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an exarnination 0f the commander-in-chief and magiftratos of the plaee, they positively and unanimousIy affirmed, that, about five years bef-\nore, a cerlain Heyduke, named Amold Paul, had been hcard lo say, that, at Cassovia, on lhe froriticrs of the Turkjsh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himsclf with his bl0od. Thif precaution, however, did not prevent hirn from becoming a vclmpyre himseIf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial,many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four pcrsons had beeri deprived of life by his attacks. To provent furthcr mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is suppased to be usual in caseſ of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and ernitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure arid florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they ros0rted to lhe accustomcd remedy. A slake was driven eritirely tbrough thc heart and body of Arnold Paul, al which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. Thif done, lhey cut off his head, burned his body, andthrew the ashes into bis grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of thoseperfans who had previously died from vampyrisin, lest they shouId, in their turn, become agenls vpon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person ſucked by a vampyre bec0mes a vampyre himself, and sucks in hiſ turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis inonstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better odapted to jllustrate the subject of the present ohservatjons than any 0thcr instance which cauld be adduced. In many parts of Grecce it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, f0r some heinous crime committcd whilst in existence, that lhe dececlsed is not only doomed to vampyrise, bvt compelled to confirie hls infernal visitations solely lo those bcings he loved most while upon earth—thofe to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and afsection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, af Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly baunl the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain lhe streom of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy liuid living corse, Thy victimf, ere lhey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must faIl, The youngest, best beloved of alI, Shall bless lhee with a father's name— That word sball wrap thy heart in flamo! Yet thov must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye'ſ last spark, And the last glassy glance must vicw Which free2es o'er its lifeless bluo; Then with unhallowed hand ſhall tear The treſses of her yellow hair, Of whlch, in life a lock when shom Asfection's fondost plcdge was worn— But now is horno away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing t0oth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afritf rave, TlIl the se in horror shrink awcly From spectre inore accursed than they.\nMr. Southey hos also iritroduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returncd froin the grave for tbe purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilsl in existence. But this cannol be supposod lo have resultcd from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourlrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a cornplete type 0f purity and innocencc. The veraciouſ Tournefort gives a long aceount in his travels of several astonishing cases of uampyrisin, to which he pretends to have been an cyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upori this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustralive oflts esfects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending t0 prove it to be a c lassical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and intorefting notices on this singularly horrible superstition mighl be added; thoughthe present may suffice for the limits of a nate, necessorily devo-\nted to explanati0n, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that thougb the term Vampyre iſ the one in most general aooeptation, there are several 0thers ſynonymous with it, made use of in various parts of lhe worId: as Vroucolocha, Vardaulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happcried that in the midst of the dissipcllions attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of lhe lon a nobleman, more remarkablo for hiſ singvlarities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around hiin, as if he could not participotothereiri. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his altention, that he might by a look quell it, and lhrowfear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those wha felt this sensatian of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the deadgrey eye, which, fixing upon the object's faoe, did not seem to penetrate, ond at one glance to pierce through to the inword workings of the heclrt; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it cauld not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited lo every house; all wished to see him, and tbose who had been aecustomed to violerit excitement, and now felt the weight of ennul, were pleased at having ſomething in tbeir presence capable of engaging their altention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, eithor from the blvsh of modesty, or srom the strong emotiori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, mariy of the femalo hunters aftcr notoriety atlempted ta win his attontions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affectian: Lady Mercer, who had heen the mockery of every monster shewn in drawjng-roams sirice her morriage, threw herself in his way, and djd all bvt put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she st0od before him, though his eyes wcre apparently fixed upon hor's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her uriappalled impudence waſ baffled, and she left the field. But tbough the comman ad ultress could riol influence even lhe guidclnce af his eyes, il was not that the female sex was indifferent to hirn: yet such was the apparent caution witb whioh he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few kriew he ever addreſsed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wirining t0ngue; and whethcr it waf that it even overcame the dread of his singular characler, or that lhey were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, be was as often among those females who form lhe boclst of their sex from thcir domestic virtues, as among those who sul1y it by tbeir vices.\nAboul the samctimc, th ere came to L0ndon a yourig gentleman os the name ofAvbrey: he was an orphan left with an only sisler in tho possession of great wea1th, by parents who died while he was yel in chiIdhood. Left also to bimself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortvne, while they relinquisbed the more important chargeof his mind to the care of mercenclry subalterns, he cultivated inore his imaglnatlon lhan his judgment. He had, hence, that high r0mantjc feeling of honour clnd candour, which daily ruins so mony milliners' apprcntices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vioe was thrown in by Pr0vidonce merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thaught that the misery of o cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the pairiter's eye by th eir irregular folds and various co1oured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreclms of poets were the rea1ities of life. Hc was handsomo, frank, arid rich: for these reclsons, upon hiſ entering into the gay circles, many mothers furrovnded hjm, slriving whichshould descrjbe with least truth thoir lariguishing or romping favourjtes: the doughters at tbe same time, by their brightenirig countenances wheri be approacbcd, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into fcllse notions of his talents and bis merit. Attached as he was t0 the romance of hif solitary hours, he wasstartled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wox caridles that flickered, not from tbe presence of a ghost, but from want of sriuffing, there was rio foundation in real life for clny of that congeries of pleasing pjctures and descriptions contained jn those volumes, from which he had f0rmcd his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary belng we have above described, crossed him in bis career.\nHe watcbed him; and the very impoſsibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in bimself, who gave few other signs of his observation of oxternal abiects, lhan the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing hif imaginatian to pictvre every thing tbat slattered its propensity to extrovagant ideas, he soon formed thisobject into the hero of a romance, and dctermined to observe tho offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted wlth him, paid him attentlons, and s0 far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recogriised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs wcre embarrassed, and soon faund, from the notes of preparation iri — Streot, tbat he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, wh0, till now, hod only whetted his euriosjty, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for birn t0 perform the tour, which for inany generations has been thoughl necessary to enable the young to take some rclpid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to clppear as if fallen from thc skies, whcnever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degreo of skill shewn in carryjrig lhem on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his lntentions to Lord Ruthven, waf surprised to rcceive from hlm a proposal lo jainhim. Flatterod by such a mark of estecm srom him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the cjrcling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrcy had had no opportunity of study ing Lord Ruthven'ſ character, and now he found, that, though many moro of his act-\ni0ns were exposed to his view, the results offcred different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His compclnion was profuse in his lib erality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than onough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubreycauld not avojd remarkirig, that it was not upon the uirtuous, reduced t0 indigence by the misfortunos altendarit even up0n virtue, that be bestowed hjs alms;—these were sent from the doar with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to osk something, not to relieve hiſ wants, 6ut to allow him towallow in his lust,or to sink him still dceper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charjty. This was, howover, attributed by him to the greoter imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigenl. There was one circumstance about the charity af his Lordship, whicb was still more impressed upori his mind: clll those upon whom it was bestowed, jnevitably found tbat there was a curse upon it, for they were al1 eith er Ied to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other lowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his campanion soughl for the centres of all fashionable vice; tberc hc entered into a1l the spiril of thc faro tclble: he betted, and alwa ys gamb1ed with success, except where lhe known sharper was his clntag0nist, and then be lost even more thcln he gained; but it was always with the same uncbanging face, with wbich ho generally watched the society around: it was not, however, ſo wben he encountered the rash youthful navice, or the luckless father of a numcrous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstraotedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more firo than thot of the cat whilsl dallying with the half-deod mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent yauth, torn srom the circle he adorned, cursing, in the ſ0litude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single fartbing of his lateimmense wealth, wherowith to buy even ſufficierit to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immedicltely lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder hc had just snatched from the convulfive grasp of the innocent:this might but be thc result of a certain degree of knowledge, which waſ not, however, capable of combating thecvnning of the more experienced. Avbrey 0ften wished lo represent this to bis friend, and bcghim to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, arid did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—far each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of spcaking frclnkly and opo nly to hirn; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven jn his carriage, and amidst the uarious wild and rich scenes of nature, was alwaysthe same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification froin it than the constanl excitement os vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exa1ted imagination begari to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a tiine lost sight of his compclnion; he left him jn daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Itallan countess, whilst he went in scarch of the rnemorials 0f ari0ther almost deserted city. Whi1st he wcls thus engagod, letters arrived from England,which be opened with eager impatierice; the first was from his siſter, breathing riothing but asfection; the others were from his guardians,the latter astonished him; if it had bofore entered into his imagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these ſeemcd to give him sufficient rcason for lhe helief. His guardians insifted upon hls immediately leavlng his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irrosiſtible p0wers of soduction, reridered bjs 1icentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been disoovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatrod of her choracter; but thathe had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, tbe partncr of his guilt, shovId be hurled from the pinnacle of unsul1ied virtv e, down to the lowest abyss of infamy clnd degrcldation: iri fine, that all thase femaleſ whom he hcld ſought, appareritly on account of their vjrtue, had, since his departure, tbrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of tbeir vices to the pubIic gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leavjng one, whose choracter had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolued to invent some p1ausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposjng, ln the mean while, lo watcb him more closely, and to let no slighl cjrcuinstances pass by unnoticed. He entored into the same circle, and so0n perceived, that bis Lordship was endeavouririg to work upon the inexperionce of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequeriled. In Italy, it is seldom thot an unmarricd female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on bis plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered lhat an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innooent, though th0ughtless g irl. Losing rio time, he entercd the apartmerit of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly aſked him his intentions with rcspect to the lady, iriforming him at the same time that he was aware of hls being about to mect her that verynight. Lord Ruthven answerod, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have vpori such an occasion; and upon being presscd whe-\nther he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey rctired; and, immediately writing o note, to say, thal from that moment he must decline accompanying hls Lordship in the remajnder of their pr0posed tovr, he 0rdered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her 0f all be knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of hls Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day mercly sent his servarit to riotify his complete assent to a separation; hut did not hjnt any suspiclon of his plans havirig been soiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dirocted bis steps towards Greece, and orosſing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Alhcns. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and saon ocoupied himsclf in traeing the faded records of ancient g lory upon monuments lhat apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling lhe deeds of sreemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and de1icate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope ofthe faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plclin, or tripped along the mou ntain's side, orie would have thought the gclzelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated natvre, sar thot sleopy luxuriovs look of the animal sulted but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search aftor antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole heauty of her form, floating as it were upon tbe wind, lo the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upori an almost offacod tahIet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofteri would her tresses falllng, as she flitled around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it migbt wol1 excuse the forgetfulness af the antlquary, who let escclpe from his mind the very objecthe had before thougbt of vital imporlance to the pr opor intcrpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but norie con appreciate?—It was innoccnce, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-ro0ms and stif1ing baIls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preſerve a meinorial sor his fvture hours, she would stand by, and wotch the rnagic esfects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her notive place; she would theri describe to him the circling dance up0n thc open ploin, w0uld paint, lo him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp sheremembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greatcr impression vpon her mind, w0uld tell him all the supernatural talcs of ber nurse. Her earnestriess and apparent bolief of what shenarrated, excited lhe interest even of Aubrey; and aften as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his frjendf, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upori the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence sor the ensuing months, hiſ blood would run cold, whilst be attempled to laugh her ovt of ſuch idle and horrihle fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him tbe names of old men, who hadat last detected one living among themselves, after several of lheir near relatives and childr en had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; clnd when shefound him so incredulous, shebegged af him to bolieve her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had darcd to question their existence, olways had somo proof given, which obliged them, with grief and hearlbreaking, to confess it was trvo. She detailed to him tbe troditiorial appoaronce of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate dcscription 0f Lord Ruthven; he, bowever, slill persisted in persuclding her, thal there could be no truth in ber fears, though at thc sametimc he wondered at themany coincidences which bad all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey hogan to attach himself more and more to Iarithe; hcr innocence, so contrasled with all the affectod virtues of the women among whom hc had sought for his vision of romance, won hls heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Englishhabits, ina rrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more ond more attached lo the almost fairy form befare him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, f0rming a plan for some anliquarian research, he would depart, detormined not to return vntil his object wcls attained; but he always found it imposfible to fix hif attention upon tbe ruins araund him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the righ tful possessor of his thaughls. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was eucr the same frarik infantile being he had first kriown. She always seemed to part from him withreluctance; but it was because she hod no 1onger any one with whom sbe could visit hcr favourite hauntf, whilst her guardian was occupiodin sketching or uncovering some fragmentwhioh had yet escaped tbe destructive harid of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several presenl, affirmed their existence,pale with horror at the very name. Soon aster, Aubrey determined t0 proceod upon one of his exoursions, which was to detain him f0r a few hours; when they heard the name of tho place, they all at once begged of him riot to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would evcr reinain, after thc day had closed, upon any c0nsiderat ion. They described it as the resorl of the vampyres iri their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most heavy evils af impending upori him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey inade light of their representatians, and tried to lough tbem out of the idea; but whenbe saw thein shudder at his daririg thus to mock a superior, infemal pawer, thc very name of which apparently made tbeir bIood freeze, he waf silent.\nNext morning Auhrey set off upon his excursion uriattended; he wossurprised to o6serve the melancholy face of his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those h0rrible fiends, had inspjred them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Iantbe came to the sidc of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he prornised. Hc was,however, so occupied in his research, that be did nol perceive that day-light wauld soon end, and that in the borizon there was one os those specks which, jn tho warmer climales, so rapidly gather into a trernendous mass, ond pour aIl thoir rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, m0unted hif horse, dotermined to rnake up by speed for his delay: but it was too lote. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the svn ſets, riight begins:and ero he bad advanced far, the power of tbe storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick beavy rcliri forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst tbe blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took sright, and he was carrled witb drecldful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, slopped, and he found, by the glare of lightnlng, that he waf in tbe neighbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrovnded it. Dismovnting, he approached, hoping to find some one to gujde him to the l own, or clt least trusting to obtain ſhelter from the pelting of tbc storm. Af he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed bim to hear the dreadful shrieks of a wornan mingljng with the ſtifled, exultant mockeryof a lavgh, continued jn one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with o svdden effort, forced open the daor of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, tbough he called, still the sounds eoritinued, and no notice waf taken of him. He found himself in contacl with some one, whom he immediately soi2ed; when a uoice crled, \"Again baffIed!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; ond he felt himself grappled by onc whose strength seemed superhumari: determined lo sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from bis feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself vpon him, and kneelirig upon his breast, hadplaced his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave Iight in the day, disturbed hiin;—he instanlly rose, and, leaving his prey, rvshed thr ough the door, and iri a momeril the crashing of the branches, as be broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; arid Auhrey, incapabIe of movin g, was soon heard by those without. They enlered; the light of their torches fell vpon tbe mvd walls, and the tbatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flclkes of saot. At the dcsire of Aubrey they seorched for her who had attracted hiin by her ories; ho wos again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more hurst upon hlm, to perceive the airyform of his foir oonductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visiori ariſing from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same farm, when ho unclosed them, strctched by his side. There was no eolour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness a bout her foce that seemed almost as attaching as the life thclt once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat wore thernclrks of teeth having opened the vein:—to thiſ the men pointod, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickIy formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side os her who had lately been to him the object os so many brighl and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lise that had died wilhin her. He knew not what his tboughls were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and takc refuge in vacaricy—he hold almost unconsclously in his hand a riaked dagger of a pclrticular construction, which hod heen found in the hut. They were soon met by differenl parties who bad becri engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the cily, forewarned lhe parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To deſcribe their gricf would be impos sible; but when they ascertained the cause of their c hild's dcath, they looked al Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were jnconsolable; both died brokeri-hearted.\nAubrey boing put to bed waſ seized with a most violent fever, and waſ often delirious; iri these intervals he would call upon LordRuthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combinotlon he seerned to beg of his former companion to ſpare the heirig he loved. At other times he would imprecate malediclions up0n hls bead, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time ta arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately ploced bimself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. Wheri the latter recovered from hiſ dclirium, he was horrisied and startled at the sigbt of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying aImast repcntance for the fault that had cauſed their separation, and still more by the ottention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconoiled bim to his presence. His lordship seeinedquite changed; he n0 longer appeared that apathetie belrig who bad so asloriishod Aubrey; but of saon as his convaleſcence began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into tbe same statc of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difserence from the former man, except thclt at times he was surprised lo meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of maIici0us cxultati0n playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smi1e hauntod him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven waf appar ently engaged in watching the tideleſs waves raifed by the cooling breeze, or in marking lhe progress of those or6s, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, be appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of aIl.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, waſ much weakened, and lhat elasticlty of spirit which had 0nce so distinguiſhed him now seemed to have sled for ever. He was now as muoh a louer of solitude and silencc as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solilude, his mind could not find it in the neigh6ourhood of Athens; is he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stoad by his side—if hc sought il in the woods, her light step wovld appear wandering amidsl the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; theri suddenly turning round, would sbow, to hjs wild imagination, her palc face and woundod throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined t0 fly scenes, every seclture of which created such bitter associatioris in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held himself bound by the lender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit thosc parts of Greece neither had yet seeri. Thcy travelled in every direction, and sought every spot lo wbich a reoolIection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yct they seemed not lo heed what tbey gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they irnagined were only thc invention of individuals, whose interest it wcls to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from protcnded darigers.In consequence of thus neglecting the advlce of the irihabitants, on one occasion they travelled witb only a fow guards, more ta scrvc cls guides than as a de fence. Upon entering, bowever, a riarrowdefile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses 0f rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiceſ, tbey had reason to repent thelr negligenco; for scarcely were the whole of lhe party engaged iri the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of 6ullets cIose to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, plaoing themselves hehjnd rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, rctired for a moment bchind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, jf any of the robbcrs shou1d climb ahoue and take thom in the reor, they determined at onco to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had lhey lost theshelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to lhe grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest 0r his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately throwri up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promjseſ of greclt rew-\nard, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wourided friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having ogreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by thoir presence—they beingcontent mcrely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the pramised sum, for which he bad an order. Lord Ruthven's ſtrength rapidly dccroased; in two days mortification ensued,arid deatb seemed advancing with hasty stepf. His conduct and appcarance had notchanged; be seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his rnind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixod upon Aubrey, who waſ induced lo offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more lhan that—I mean riot my life, I heed the death of my existence as little af that of thc passing day; but you may save my hariaur, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Avbrey.—\"I need but littlc—my 1ife ebbs apace—I cclnnol explain the whole—but if you would oonceal all y0u know of me, my hanour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall nol bo known.\"—\"Swear!\" crjed the dyirig man, raising himself with exullant vi0lence, \"Swear hy all your sou1 reveres, by all y0ur nature feors, sweclr that, for a yeor ond a day you will not iinpart your knowled ge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His cyeſ seemed burſting fr0m their ſockels: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no rnore.\nAubrey rctlred lo rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstanccs attending his aoquaintance with this man r0se upon his inind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a c0ld shiverlng came 0ver him, as if from the presentiment 0f somethirig horrible awaiting him. Rising early in lhe morning, he was about to eriter thc hovcl in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met birn, and informed him that it was no longer there, having beeri conveyed by hirnself and comrades, upon his retiring, to tho pinnacle of a rieighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lor dship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon thatrose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined lo go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, wherihe had mounted to the summit he found n0 lrace ofeitber the corpse or the clothes, thaugh tho robbers swore they pointed out the identical r0ck on whioh they had 1aid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convincod tbat they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a counlry in which he had met wjth such terriblc misf0rtunes, and in wbich allclpparently conspired to heighten that superslitious rnelancholy that had seized upon his mind, he rcsolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to oonuey him to Otranto, or ta Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging ta Lord Ruthven.Amongst other lhjngs there wcls a cafe containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the deatb of the victim. Thero were several daggerſ and ataghanſ. Whilst turning them over, and examining thcir curious sorms, what was his svrprise at finding a sheatb opparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastoning to gain further pro0f, he fourid the weapon, and hishorror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly sbaped, the shealh he held in his hand. His eyes seerned to need no furthor certainly—they feemed gazlng to be bound to the dclgger;yet still he wished to disbelievc; but the particular form, tho same varying tints upon the haft and sbeatb were alike in splcridour on both, and left no room for doubl; there were also drops of bIood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hisway home, at Rome, hjs fjrst inquiries were coricerning the lady he had attempled to snatch fr0m Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distrcss, their fortune rujned, and fhe had not boen heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mirid became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he wos afraid that this lady had fallen a vietim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morafe and sllent; and his only occupationconsisted iri urging the speed of the postill0ns, as if he were going to save tbe life 0f some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; o breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of bjs fathers, and there, for a momcrit, appeared to lose, iri the embraces and oaresses of his sister, olI memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantjne oaresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a eompanion.\nMiss Aubrey had not thclt winning grace which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that ljght brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never Iit up by the levity of tbe mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it whichdid not seem to arise from mlsfortune, hut from some feeling within, tbat appearedto indicate cl soul conscious of a brighter realm. Hcr step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a 6utterfly or a colour may attract—it was fedate and pensive. When olone, her face was never 6rightened by the smile of joy; but when her hrother breathed to her his affectjon, and wouId in her presence sorget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would bclve exchariged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were theri playing in lhe ligbt of their own natiue sphere. Shewas yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been tbought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayod vntil her brother's return from tbe continent, when he mjght be her protector. It was now, thoresore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fasl approachirig, fhould be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mclnslon of his fathers, and fed upon lhc melancholy which averpowered him. He could nol feel interest about the frivolities of fashiona ble strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; 6ut he determined to sacrifice his own comf0rt to the protection of his sister. They ſoon arrived in town, and prepared for the nexl day, which had been announced as a drawing-r oom.\nThe cr0wd was exceſsive—a drawlng-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smi1e of roycllty, haslened thither. Aubrey wcls there with his sister. Whjle he was standing in a corner by himſelf, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrarice that the first time ho had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in that vory placc—he felthimself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sovnded in bis ear—\"Remem6er your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, searsul of feeing a spectre tbat would blast him, when he perceivod, at a litlle distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice 0n thif spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost resusjrig to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm 0f a friend, and forcing a passage through the crawd, he threw himsels into his carriage, and was drlven home. He poced tho room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, aſ if he were afraid his thoughts were bvrsting from his brain. L0rd Ruthven again bes ore him—circumstances starled up in dreadful arrcly—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himsels, he couldnot beliove it possible—thc dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossihle that it could be real—be determinod, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his ljps, and he could not sueceed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his slstor to the assembly of a ncor relation. Leavlng her undor the protection of a matr0n, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thougbts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering anothcr room, fourid his ſister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest converscltion; he attempted to pasſ and get near her, whcn one, whom he requested to movc, turned round, ond revealed to him lh0se features hc most a6horred. He sprang forward, seized hls sister's arm, and, with hurriod step, forced her towards the street: at the door he f0und bimself impeded by the crowd of ſervarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he waſ engaged iri passing them, he agaln heclrd that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He didnot darc lo turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost diftracted. If bes0re hismind had been absorbed by onc subject, how rnuch more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainly of the monster'f living again proſsed upon his thovgbts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was ln voin that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He on1y uttered a few words, and those terrified hor. The more he thought, the more be was bewildcred. His oath startledhim;—was he then to a1low lhls monster lo raam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by hiin. But even if he were to break his oath, and disc1ose his suspicions, wbo would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretoh; bvt death, he remembered, had been already m0cked. For days he rernained in tbis state; shut up in hifroom, be saw ri0 one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sclke, to support natvre. At lasl, no longer capable af bearing stillness and solitvde, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly thclt iinage which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, cls oflen oxposed to the noon-day fun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed peaple to follow him; but thcy were soon distanoed hy bim wh0 fled from apursuer swifter than any—frorn thought. Hiſ conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of bis friends, with a fiend amongst them, os whosc presence they were unconscious, he determined t0 enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxi0us to farewam, in spite of his oath, aIlwhom Lord Ruthven appraached with jntimacy. But wheri he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious lookf were so striking, his inward sbudderings so visib1e, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strangly. Wheri,however, romanstrance proved unavailirig, the guardions thought properto interpoſe, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they th0ught it high tiine to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parenls.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountcred in hjs wanderlngs, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those inclrks of what they consjdercd folly, lhey engoged a physician to reside in the h0use, and take coristant care of him. He hardly appeclred to notice it, sa cornpletely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at 1ast so greclt, that he was confined to hls chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He bad became emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affection and reoollection remainirig displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then ho would sometimes start, and, soizing her hands, with looks that severely afflieted her, he would desire hcr not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch bim—if your lovefor me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he reserred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into cl state, w herice not even she could rouse him. Thls lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was pasſing, hjs incohorences became less srequent, and his mind threw off a portion ofitf gloom, whilst his guardians observed, thot several times in the day he would covnt upon hisfingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, w hen, upon the last day of the year, ono of his guardians erilering his room, began to converse with hjs physician upori the me1aricholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his sister was going next day to he married. InstantIy Aubrey's atlention was attraeted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark ofreturning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with ln society,Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be prosent at the nuptials, and desiring lo see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. Hc was apparentIy again capable os being asfected by lhe inf1uence of her lovely smile; for he pressed hor to his breast, and kissed her cheek,wet with tears, flowing at the lhought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with allhis wonted warmth, and to congrotulate her upon her marriage wlth o person so distinguifhed forrank clnd every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceiued a looket upon her breast; opening it, whal was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who bad so lorig inflvencedhis life. He seized the portrait in a par0xysm of rage, and trclmpled it under soot. Upon her askirig hirn why he thus destroyed the resemblclnce of her future hufband, he looked as if he didnot understand her—then seizing ber hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she wov1d never wed thif monster, for he— But he covld not advarice—it seemed as if that voice agclin bade him rcmernber his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lard Rulhven was near him but saw no one. In the meantimethe guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought tbis waf but cl relurn of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. Ho fell upon his knees to them, he irnplored, he begged of them to do1ay but for one day. They, attrjbuting this to the insanity tbey imagined had takeri possessi0n of his mind, cndeavoured to pacisy hirn, and rctired.\nLord Ruthven had eaIled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refuscd with every one elfe. Wberi he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cavse of it; but when he learned that he was deerned inſane, his exultatjon and pleasure could hardly bo concealed from those among whom he hcld gained this information. He hastened lo the house of his former eompanion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affectiori for tbe brother and intereft in his fate, he gradually wan the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who cauld resist his power? His ton guohad dangers and toils to recounl—could speak of himself as of an indivldual having no sympathy wlth any being on the crowded earth, ſavc with her to whom he addressed himself;—couId tell how, since he knew her, hif existence, had begun to seem worthy of proservation, if jt were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knewso well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the wiIl of fate, that he gained her asfections. The title of the elder branoh falling at lerigth to him, be obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hofteriing lhe marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged ſlate,) which was to take place the uery day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrcy, when he waſ left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to hribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it waf given him; he wrote a 1otter to his sisler, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the hon0vr af those now ln the graue, who once held her in their arms af lheir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few haurs that marriage, on which he denounced lho most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it bettor not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to tho busy inmatef of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a borror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Tbe curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilanoe, they grcldually stole away, leavirig him in the cvstody of an helplesf old woman. He seized thc opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in cl mornent found himsels in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the firſt to percejve hirn: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him srom the room, speechless with r age. When on tho stoircase, Lord Ruthven whjspered in his ear—\"Reinember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is disbonoured. Women are frail!\" So ſaying, he pushed him towards his ottendants, wha, raused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey covld no langcr support bimfe1f; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, andhe was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicjan was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness jncreased; the effusion 0s blaod produced symptoms of the near approach ofdeath. He desircd his sister's guardians might be called, and when lhe midnight hour had struck, he rel ated coinposedly whot the reader has pervsed—he dicd immediately after.\nThe guardionshastened to protecl Mlss Aubrey; but when thcyarrived, it wcls too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's fister had glutted thc thirsl of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all hefore him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providerico his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board one of bif Majesty's vessels, iri tbe year 1812, we put into the harbour af Mityl-\nene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this pIace, and tho certain supply of cattle and vegetables olways to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies ralher out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for lhe deviation of a voyage. We landed; as vsual, at the boltom of the bay, clnd whilst the men were employed jn watering, and the purser hargaining for cattIe with the natives, the clergymari and myself took a rainble to the cave called Homer's Scbool, arid other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we mel with and engaged a young Greek as our guido, wbo lold us he had come from Scio with an Engljsh lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sajd the Groek, \"and would have taken mc with him; bul I did not choose to quit Mitylene, whero I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very goodman. The cottage over the hi1l, facing theriver, belongs to him, and he has left an old man iri charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zcchines for lt, (about L250 Englisb currency,) and has resided there about f ourteen m0nths, lhough not constantly; for he sails in his felucca uery often to tbe disferent islands.\"\nThisaccounl exciled our curiosity very much, and we lost no lime in hastening tothe house where our couritryman had resided.We wero klndly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on lhe gr0und-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitling parlour, anda 6ed-room, with o spoci0us closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain groeri-stained walls, marble tablef on either side, a large myrtlo in tbe centre, and a small founlain beneatb, which could be made lo play through the branches by m0ving a spring fixed in the side of a small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large cauch ar sofa completedthe furniture. In the hall stood hals a dozen Englisb cane chairs, and an empty book-case: therc were no mir rors, nor a single painting. The bedchclmber had merely cl large mattresſ spread on the fIoor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillaw—the common bed throughout Greece. In the ſitting-room we observed a marble recess, f0rmerly, the old man told us, filled with bookf and papers, whlch were then in a large seaman's chest iri the eloset: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justi-\nfied in examining tho contents. On the tablot of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; V0Iney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German languagc; Klopstock's Messlah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's plcly of the Robbers; Milton's Paradife Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 18I0; several small pamphlets from the Greek presſ at Conslantinople, much torn, but no English book of any descriptian. Most os tbese books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itolian clnd Latin. The Mes siah was literally scribbIed all ove r, and marked with slips 0f paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The 1ord had been reading these books the evening before he sai1ed, and forgot to place them with the athers; but,\" sald he, \"there they must lie until his return; for heis fo particu1ar, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frawn up0n me far a week t0gether; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; arid I have the produce of this fclrm for the troub1e of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I poy to an aged Armenian whorcsides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought hore from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house extcrnally was pleasirig. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were conſjderably higher than the roof. The ro0f, surr ounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey oarpet, beneath an awning of strongcoarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furriished, as upon them thc Greeks pass their euenings in smoking, drinking ljght wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frvit, and enjoying the cvening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered lhehouse, a small stream1et glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clusteririg together on itſ borders, arid undor lhe shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marbIe seat with an 0rnamenlal wooden baek was placed, on which wc were told, the lord passed many 0f his evenings ond njghts till twelvo o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the ald man, \"praying\" for be was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a wee k, besidef Sundays.\"\nThc view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bjrd's-eyc view.\" A line of rlch vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins deſcended in broken cascadef, until it was l0st in the woods near the mountain's basc. The sea smoath as g1ass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a IittIe on the left, lhrough a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islonds were distinclly observed, studdirig the light blue waue with spotſ of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did tbis; bvt ovr enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person wh0 had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but D0minick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armeriian,\" said our conduct0r, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannat you lell, old friend?\" ſaid I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare riot.\" We had not lime to visit the Armeniari, but on our return to the town welearnt several particvlars of the isolated lord. He had portionod eight young girls when be wos last upan the lsland, and even daneed with them at the nuptial feast. He gave acow to ane mcln, horſes to otbers, and cotton and silk to the glrls who live by weaving lhese articles. He aIso bought a new boat for a fisherman who had loſt his own in a gale, and he often gave Greok Testaments to the poor children. Iri short, he appeared to uſ, from all we eollected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One ciroumstance welearnt, whioh our old friend at the coltage thought proper nat to disclose. He had o mosl beautifvl davghter, with whom the lord waſoften seeri walking on tbe sea-shore, and he had b0ught her a plano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the informcltion with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing wha tbis ramblcr in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he hod philanthropy of dispositiori, and all those ecce nlrlcities which mark peculiar g enjuſ. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folling in compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupll of WYATT'S, who bad been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the lsland of Tenedos, arid I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never lhen heard os his lordship's fame, as we had been same yearf from home; but \"Childo Harolde\"heing put into our hands we rccognized the recluse of CaIcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having 6een more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we oonsoled ourselves with the ldea of returning to Mitylene ori somo future day; but to me that doywill never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite vninteresting, and in justice to bis lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with humon nature, or contri6utlng ln any way to sooth its so rrows, or add to its pleaſures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from lhcse little anecdotes. Al1 the siner feelings of the h eart, so elegaritly depicted in hiſ lordship's poems, seem to bave thcir seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his aotions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reosonfor mclrking him as a beirig 0n whoseheart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose hcad Benevolence hath thrown her rnont1e. No man can read the precedirig pleasing \"traits\" without feeling pr0ud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. R eports are ever to bereceived wilh caution, particularly when dlrected against mon's moral integrity; arid ho who dares justify himself before that awful triburial where all must appear, alone may censure lhe errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy 0f his genius. To do good in secret, and shun lhe world'f applouse, is the suresltestimoriy of a virtuous heart and self-clpprovjng consclence.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-eovrt, Fleet-ſtreet.",
    "clean": "Mr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error."

Among tbe Arabians it appears to be commori: it did not, bowever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the estoblishment of Christianlty; and it has 0nly assumed lts present form since tho division of the Latin and Greek churchef; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt is buried in thejr territory, it gradually increased, and sormedthe subjeot af many wonderful stories, still extant, of thc dcad rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautifu1. In the West it spread, with some sligbt variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief cxisled, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of theblood of their victims, wh0 became emaciated, lost tbeir strength, and speedily died of consuinptions; whilsl these human blood-svckers fattened—and lheir veins became dislended to such a slate of repletion, as to couse the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from tbe very pores of thelr skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, isa ourious, and, of course, credible acoount of a particulor caſo of vampyrism, which is stated to havo occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upari an examinatlon af tbe commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they pos itively and unariimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a cerlain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the frontiers of the TurkiſhServia, he had been tormented by a vclmpyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of tbe vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his hlood. This precclution, however, did nat prevent bim from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about lwenty or thirty days after his death and burial, inany persons complained of bavingbeen lormented by hjm, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by hiſ attocks. To preventfurther rnischics, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, arid found it (as is ſupposed to be ufual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emjttirig at the mouth, nose, and ears, purc and florld blood. Proof hauirig been thvs 0btained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, thcy cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the asheſ inlo his grave. The same measures were adopted with the c0rses of those persons wh0 had previously died from vampyrism, lost they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who svrvived them.\nThe universal belief is, tbat a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and suckf in his turn.\nChlef bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is bere related, be oause it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than clny other instance which could be adduced. In many parts 0f Greece it is considered cls o sort of punishmcrit afler death, for some heinous crirne committed whilst in exlstence, that the doceased js not onIy doomed to vampyrise, but compelled lo consine his infernal visitations solelyto those beings he l0ved most while upon eartb—tbose to whom he was bound by ties of kjndred and afseotion.—A supposition alluded to in tbe \"Giaour.\"\nBul first on eartb, as Vampyre sent, Tby corso ſhall from its tomh be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native pIclce, And suck the blood of all thy race; Tbere sromthy daughter, slster, wife, At midnight droin the stream of life; Yet loathe the bariqvet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Sha1l know the domon for their sire; As cursing thee, tbou cursing them, Thy flowers aro withered on thc stem. But one lhclt far thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— Thal word shall wrop thy heart iri flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—ber eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freczes o'er its lifeless 6lue; Then witb unhallowcd hand fhall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of wbich, in llfe a lock whon shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by lhee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnasbing tooth, and haggord lip; Then slalking to thy sullen graue, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till theso in horror fhrink awoy Froin spectre more aceursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in hif wild bul beauliful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represcnted as havlng returncd from lho grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whiIst in existenee. But this cann0t be supposed to have resulted from the finfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a completo type of purity and innacence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account jn hif travels os several astonishing cases of vampyrism, towhieb he pretends to haue boen an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratiuesillvstratjue af its effects, has pvt forth s0me learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian err0r.\nMany ourious and intcrestirig notjces on this si ngularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present moy suffice for the limits of a n0te, riecessarily devoted to explanati0n, and whi ch may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one jn most general acceptation, there are sevcral others synonyinous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a Londan winter, there appeared at the uarious parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, rnore remarkable for his singvlarities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate thcrein. Apporently, tbe light laughter of the fair only attraeted bis attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breclsts where thovghtlossness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awo, c ould not explain whence it arofe: soine attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, flxing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce througb to lhe inward worklngs of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a Ieaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. Hiſ pecullarities caused him t0 be invited to every house; all wished to see him, clnd those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, arid now felt the weight of enriui, were pleasod at havlng fometbing in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of bis face, which never gainod a warmer tjnt, eilher from the hlush of modesty, 0rfrom the strong emotion of passion, tbough its sorm and outline were beavtifvl, many of the female huriters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some morks of wbat they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the moekery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, t0 attract his noljce:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as is they were unperceiued;—evcri her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyeſ, it was not lhat the female sex was indiffererit to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuouf wife clnd innocent davghter, that sew knew he ever addressed himself to scmales. He had, however, the repvtation of a wirining longue; ond whether it was that it even ouercome the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by hjs apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those semales who form tho boast 0f their sex from their domestic virlueſ, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAboutthe sarne time, there came to London a young genlleman of thc name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sifter in lhe posscssion of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortvne, while they relinquiſbed the morc jmportant charge of his mind to the care of inerccnary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination tban his judgment. He had, hence, tbat high romantic feeling 0f honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprcntices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thoughl that vice was thrown in 6y Providenoe merely for lhe picturesque effect ofthe scene, as we see in romances: he thoughl that the misery of a coltage mcrely consisted in lhe vesting 0f clotheſ, whi ch were as worm, but which worc better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the reo-\nlilies of life. He was handſome, frank, and ric h: forthese reasons, upon his entering into the gay clrcles, many mothers surrounded him, slriving which shovld desorlbe with least truth their languishing or romping fav0urites: the daughters at the sclme time, by their brighlening countenances whon he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his Iips, soon led him into false notions of his talcrits and his merit. Atlached as hc wos to the romance of his solitary hours, he was start1ed at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles thal flickered, not fram the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was rio foundation in real life forany of that corigeries of pleosing pictures and descriptions contained in thoſe volumes, from which he had formed hjs study. Firiding, however, some compenscltion in his gratified vanity, he was abovt to relinqvish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crosscd him in hjs career.\nHe wcltehed him; ond the uery impossibilily of forming an idea of the chclracter os a mon entjrely absorbed in himself, who gave few other ſigns of his obfervation of external objects, lhan the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidancc of their contact: all0wing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered itf propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romancc, arid delermined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before bim. He became acquainted with him, paid him clttentions, and so far advanced upon his notjce, that his presonce waf always recognised. He gradually learntthat Lord Ruthven's offairs wereembarrassed, arid soon found, srom the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous os gaining some informcltion respecting this singular charactcr, who, till now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardianſ, that it wcls time for him to perform the tour, which for many gerieralions has beon thought necessory to enable the young to take some rapid steps in tho carcerof vice towards putting themselveſ upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing lhem t0 appear as if fallen from the skjes, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioncd as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrylng them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive srom him a proposalto join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, bad notbing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, orid in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitberto, Au6rey had had no opportunily of studylng Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposod to his vlew, the results offered different conclvsions from tbc apparent motiues to his conduct. His companion was profvse in his libercllity;—the idle, thc vagabond, ond thobeggar, received srom his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could not avoid rernarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the miffortunef attendclnt euen upon virtue, that he beſtowed hjs olrns;—these were sent froin the door with hardly ſuppresfed ſneers; but when the profllgate came to clſk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow bim to wallow in his lusl, or to sink hiin still deeper in his iniquity, ho was sent away with rieh charity. Thif was, however, attributed by him to the greoter importunity 0f the vicious, which generolly prevails over the retlring bash fulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance obout the charity of his Lordship, which was still inore impressed upon bis mind: all those upon whoin it wcls hestowed, inevitab1y found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lowost and the most abject mifery. At Brussels and other towns thraugb which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at lbe apparent eagerness with which bis companion sought for lbe centres of all fasbionable vice; there he enlered into all the spirit of lhe faro tclble: ho betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he loſt even more than be gclined; bvt it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he gencrally watched the society ar0und: it was n0t, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful riovice, or the lucklessfother of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed sortune's law—this apparont abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyef sparkled with more flre thari that of the cat whilst dallylng wilh tho half-dead rnovse. In every town, he left theformerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, iri the solitude of a dungeon, the satc that had drawn him within the reaeh 0f thiſ fiend; whilst many a father sat srantic, amidft the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wea1th, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satissy thelr present craving. Yet he took no money fram the gambling table; but immedialely lost, to tbe ruirior of mony, thelast gilder he had just snatcbed from the convuIsive grasp of the irinoeerit: this might hut be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, howevcr, capable of combating the cunnirig of the inore expcrienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend,and beg hiin to resign that eharity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not teridlo bis own prafit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speclking frankly and openly to him; however, this neuer occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the variovs wild and rich scenes of nature, was cllways the same: his eye spoke less than hif lip; and though Aubrey was near thoobject of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant exciteinent of vainly wjshlng to broak tbat mystery, which lo hjf exalted imagination begari to assume thc appearance of something supernatural.\nThey so0n arrivcd at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he lefthim in daily attendance vpon the mornjng circle ofan Italian counleſf, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almoft descrted city. Whilst he was thus ongaged, letters arrived from Englarid, which he opened with eager impalience; the first was from his sister, breathing n0thing but affcction; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonifhed him; if it had before entered irito his jmagination that there was an evil power resident in his comporii0n, these seemed to give hiin sufficient reason for the belief. Hls guardians insisted upon bis iminediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his charclcter was dreadfully vicious, sor that tbe possosſion os irresistible powers of seduo-\ntian, rendered his licontiouf habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his coritempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had requirod, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, lhat all thosc females whom he bad soughl, apparently on account of thejr virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had n0t scrupled to expose the whole deformity of thejr vices to the publlc gazc.\nAubrey determined upori leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright p0int on which to rcst the eye. He resolvcd to invent some plavsible protext for abandoninghim altogelher, purposing, in the mean while, lo watch hlm more cl0sely, ond to let no slight circumstances pass by unnotioed. He entered into the same circIe, and soon perceived, lhat his Lordship was endeav0uring to work upon the inexperienee of the daughter os the lady whose house he chiefly frequenled. In Italy, il is scldom that an unmarrjed female is met with in society; he was therefore obIiged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all hif windings, and saon discovered that an assignation had bcen appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thovghlless girl. Losing no timc, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly clsked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same tiine that be was aware of bis being about to moet her tbat very night. Lord Ruthven answered, thclt his intentions were such as he supposed all wovld have upon such an occasion; and upon bejng pressed whether he intended to marry hor, merely laughed. Avbrey retlred; and, irnmediately writing a note, to say, that from that momcnt he must decline accompanying hls Lordsbip in theremairider of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, inf0rmed her os all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthvcn next day inerely sent hisservant to notjfy his eomplete assent to a separation; but did riot hint any suspici0n of his plaris having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Romc, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece,and crossing tbe Peninsula, soori found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the hause of a Greek; and soon accupied himself in tracing the fadod recordf of clricient glory upon mariuments that apparently, asborned of chronicling tbe deeds os freemen only befare slaves, bad hidden themselves beneath the shelterjng soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as bjmself, exisled a being, so beautisul and delicate, that sho mlghl have formed lhe model for a pajnter wishing to pourtray on canvasſ the pr0mised hope of the fajthful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too mveh mind far any one to thjnk she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pIain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor lype of her beauties; for who wouId have exchanged ber eye, apparently the eye of clnimated riature, for that slcepy luxurious look of tbe animal suited but to the laste of an epicure. The lighl step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrcy in his search after antiquities, and often would thc uncansoiouſ girl, engaged in the pursvil os a Kashmere hutterf1y, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon thc wind, to lhe eager gaze ofhim, who forgot the 1etters be had just decyphered up0n an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Dften wovldher tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhjbit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swjftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thaught of vital importance to lhe proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms wh ieh all feel,but norie can appreciate?—It was innocence,youtb, and beauty, unaffocted by crowded drawing-rooms and stif1ing balls. Whilsl he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a rnemorial for his future hours, she wovld starid by, and watch the magjc effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native plclce; she would then describc to him tbe eircling dance upori the open pIain, w0uld paint, to him in all the gl0wing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently inade a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all tbe supernatural tales of her nvrse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narraled, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed yoars amid st his friends, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong hls existence for the onsving months, his blood would rvn cold, whilſt bo attempted to laugh her out of such idle ond horrible fanta sies; but Ianthe citcd to hiin the names of old meri, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives clndchildron had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she sourid him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that thase who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obligcd them, with grief and heartbreoking, to confess it was true. She detcliled to him the traditional appearanceof these moristers, arid his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly accurate descriptian of Lord Ruthven; he, howcver, still porsisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth inber fears, though at tbe same time he wondered at tbe many coincidcnces which had all tended to excite a belies in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthucn.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and moro to Ianthe; her innoconce, so contrasted with all the affected virtucs of the women among whom he had sought far his vision of romance, won his heart; and whilehe ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying on uneducated Groek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to tho almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from hcr, and, forming a plan for some antiquarlan research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mjnd he retained an image that secmed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe waſ unconscious of his love, and wasever the same frank jnfaritile being he hcld first kriown.She always secmed to part from him with reluctance; but it was becavse she had rio longer any ane with wbom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardiari was occupied in fketching or uricovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She had appeclled to her parents on the subject 0f Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pole with horror al the very narne. Soori clfter, Aubrey determiried lo proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged af him nol to return at nighl, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever rcmain, after the day had closed, upon any consideratjon. They described il as the resort of the vampyres in thejr nocturnal orgies, and deriounced the most heavy euils as impending upon him who dared to cross tbeir palh. Auhrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh tbem oul of lhe idea; but when be saw them shudder at his daring tbus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very namo of which apparently made lheir blood freeze, he was silerit.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surpriscd to observe the melaricholy face of hiſ host, and waf concemed ta find that bjs words, mocking the belief of those harrible fiends, had inspired them wltb such terror. When he was about to deparl, Iantho cameto the side of his horse, arid eamestly begged of him t0 relurn, ore nig ht allowed the powor os theso bejngs to be put in actiori;—he promised. Hewas, however, so occupied iri his research, that he did riot perceive that day-ligbl wouldsoon end, and that in lhe horizon lhere was one of lhosespecks which, in tbe warmer c1imateſ, so rapjdly gather into o tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoled country.—He at last, however, movnted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: bvt it was too late. Twilight, in these southern c1lmotes, isalmost unknown; immediately the sun scts, night begins: and ere he had advanced for, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders bad scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue f0rked lightning seemed lo fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled sarest. The animal at lost, through fcltigue, stoppod, and he found, by tbe glare of llghtning, thathe was in the neighbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushw-\nood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to findsome one to gulde him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain sheIter from the pe1ting of thc storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a rnomenl silent, allowcd him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman iningling with the stiflod, exultant moekery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbrokon sound;—he was startled: hut, roused by the thunder which again rolled over hif bead, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was appareri-\ntly unperceived; for, thoughhe called, sti1l lhe sounds oontinued, and no notioe was takcn of him. He found himself in contact with some orie, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh suceeeded; and he felt himfelf grappled by one whose strength ſeemed superhuman: detormined to sell his life as dearly as he cauld, he ſtrvggled; but it was in vain: he was lifled from hisfeet arid hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his encmy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hls breast, had placed his handf upon his throat—when the glare of rnany torches penetrating through lhe hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him;-\n—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, aſ he bro ke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now s till; and Avbrey, incapable of moving, waſ so0n heard by those without. They ontered;the light of thelr t orches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the deſire of Aubrey they searehed sor her who had attracted him by her cries; be was again lefl in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of tbe to rches 0nce more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of hjs fair conductress brought in a lifeless corsc. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arisjng froin his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his sjde. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her ljp; yet there was a stillness abo ut her faee that seemed almost as attaching as the llfe that ance dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was bl0ad, and upon her throat were the marks of toeth havlng opened thc vein:—to this the men poirited, crying, simultancously struck witb horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was qvickly sormed, and Aubrey was lajd by the sjde of her who had lcltely been to hjm lhe o6ject of so rnany bright and fajry visloris, now fallen with the flower of life thot bad died within ber. He knew not whal his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and s eemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almoft unc0nsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a partioular construction, which had been found in the hut. They werc soon met by different parties who bad beon engoged in the search of her whom a motber had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents os some dreadful catastraphe. —To describe their grief would be impossible; hut when they afcertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and poirited to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubroy being put to bed was seized with a most violent fcver, and was 0ften delirious; in these intervals he would oall upon Lord Ruthven and up0n Iantho—by somc unaccounta6le combination he seemed to beg of his former c0mpanion to spare the heing he loved. At other times he would irnprecate moledictions upon his hcad, and curso him as her destroycr. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrivo at Athens, and, from whateuer motiue, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, irnmediately placed himself in tbe ſame house, and becaine his confta nt allendant. When the latter recoverod from hisdelirium, he was horrified arid ftartled at tho sight of bim whoſe image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; 6ut Lord Ruthvcn, by his kind words, irnplying almoſt repentance for the faull that had caused their separation, and stiIl more by the attontjon, anxiety, and carewhich he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic bcing who bad so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvalesoence began to be rapid, he again gradual1y retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrcy perceived n0 differerice from the former man, except that at times he was ſurprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: be knew not why, but this smlle baunted him. During the lclst stage of tbe involid's recovery, Lord Rutbven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waues raiscd by the cooling br eeze, or in marking the progress os those orbs, circling, like our world, the rnoveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of a1l.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was mvch weak eried, and that elasticity of spirit whjch had arice so dlstinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He wos now as mvch a lover of solit ude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much cls he wished for soIitude, his mind eould not find it jn the neighbourhood 0f Athens; jf he sovght it amidst the ruins be had formerly frcquented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would clppear wandering amidst the underwood, in q uest of the modest violet; then svddenly turning round, would sbow, to his wild imaginali0n, her pale face and wounded thr0at, with a meek smile upon her 1ips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associati0ns in hismind. Heproposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom ho held himsclf bound hy the terider care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit lhose ports of Greece noither had yet seen. They travelled in every directjon, and sought every spot to which a recolleclion could be atlached: but though they thus hastened from ploce to place, yet tbey seemed n0t to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they graduolly began to slight these reports, which they imagiried were only the invention of individvals, whose interest it was to excitc the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangcrs. In consequencc of lbus negleoting the advice of the inhabitants, ori one occasian they travelled with only a few guards, more to sorve as guidcs tban as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narraw defile, at lbe bottom of which was lhe bed of a torrent, wilh large masses os rock brovght down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reoson to repent their negligence; f0r scarcely wero the whale of the party engaged in lhe narrow pa ss, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed reporl of several guns. In an instant thoir guards had loft them, and, placing themfelvos behind rocks, had begun to fjre in the dlrection whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imilati ng their example, retired for a moment behlnd the shelteririg turn of the defile: hut ashamed of being thvſ detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade tbem advance, and being exposed to unresisting sIaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they deterrnined at once to rusb forward in search 0f the enemy. Hardly had lhey losl tbe shelter os the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot ln the shoulder, which 6rought him l0 the grourid. Aubrey hasteried to his assistance; and, no longerheeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around hlm—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up thejr arms and furrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouringcabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was n0 more disturbed by their prcsence—they being content meroly to guard the entrance till their coinrade should return with the promised sum, f0r which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidlydecreased; in two days mortification erisued, and deatb seemed advancing withhasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changod; be seemed as unconsciouſ of pain cls hc had been of the objocts about him: but towards the c1ose ofthe last evening, his mind became apparently vneasy, and his eye oftcn fixed upon Aubrey, who was iriduced to offer his assistclnce with more than uſucll earnestness—\"Assist me! yov may savo me—you may do more than that—I mean n0t iny life, I heed the death 0f my existence af liltle as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell ine how? I would do any thing,\" replied Avbrey.—\"I need bvt little—my ljfeehbs apaoe—I cannot exploin the wbole—bvt if you wou1d conceal all you know of me, my h0naur were free from stain in the wor ld's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" oried the dying mari, raislng himself with exultant violence, \"Sweclr by al1 your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a yoar and a day you will not lmpart yovr knowledge of my orimes or death to any living being in ariy way, whatever may happen, or whateueryou inay see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.\nAubrey relirod to rcst, but did not sleep; the many eircvmslances clttendjng bis acqualntanee wilh this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; whcn he remembered his oath a cold shivering came ouer him, as if from lhe presentiment of somcthing horrible awaiting him. Rising earIy in the morning, he was about to eriter the hovel in which he bad left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no loriger therc, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, vpon hif reliring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had giveri his lordship, that it sh0uld be expofed to the first oold ray of the inoon that rose aster his death. Aubrey astanlshed, and taking scveral of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he bad mounted to the summit he found no trace of eilher the corpſc or the clolheſ, thougb the robbers swore they pointed 0ut the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For cl time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried tbe corpse for the soke of tbe clotbes.\nWeary of a couritry in wbich he had mct with such terriblc misfortunes, and in whieh all apparently conſpired to heigbten that ſuperstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to loave it, and soon arrivod at Smyr ria. WhiIe waiting for a vcssel to conveyhim to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arrariging thase effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongsl other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, inore or less adapted to ensvre the dealh of the vi ctim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whjlst turning them ouer, clnd oxamining their curious forms, what was hiſ furprise at finding o sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastenirig to gain furthcr proof, he fovnd the weapon, and his borror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing lo be bound ta the dagger; yet stjll he wished to disbelieve; but the particular forin, the fame vorying tlnts upan the haft and sheath were a1ike in splendour 0ri both, and left no room for doubt; there were alfa drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home, al Rome, his first inquiries were coricerriing the lady he had attempled to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents wore in distress, their fortune ruined, ond she had not beeri heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almast broken under so mariy repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen o victim to the deftroyer of Iarithe. He became moroſe and silent; and his only occu pation consisted ln urgjng the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to sclve the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a brceze, which seerned abedient t0 his will, soon wafled him to the English shares; and he hastened to the marisionof his fathers, and there, for o moment, appeared to lose, in the ombraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of tbc past. If she before, by her infanline caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, shc was stlll more attachirig as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not lhat winning grace which gains the gaze and applavſe of the drawing-room assemb1ieſ. There was none of that light hrilliancy which only exists ln the heatcd atm0sphere of a cr0wded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seein to arise from misfortune, bul from some feeling within, that appearcd to indicale a soul conscious of a brighter roalm. Her step was not that light foating, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. Wherialone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affectjon, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have oxchanged her fmile sor that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were then playlng iri the light of their own natiuc sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been prcsenled to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be deloyed unti1 her brother's return from the continent, when he might beher protector. It was now, therefore, resolved tbat lhe next drawing-roorn, which was fast approaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rathor have remained inthe mansion of his fathers, arid fed vpon the meIaricholy whicb overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangcrs, when his mind hcld been so torn by tho e vents he had witnessed; but he determined to facrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived iri town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd waf excesſive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all wbo were anxio us to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his siſter. Whi1e he was slanding jn a oorner by himself, beedless af all around bim, engaged in the rememhronce that the first tlme he had seen Lord Ruthven was in lhat very place—he fe1t himself svddenly sei2od by the arm, and a voice he recognized too we1l, sounded in bis ear—\"Remember your oath.\" Ho hod bardly courage to turn, fearful os seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, tbe sarne figure which had attracted his notice on this spol upori his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm os a friend, arid forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burstirig from his brain. Lord Rutbven ogain before him—circumstances started vp in dreadful array—the dagger—hiſ oath.—He roused bimself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagjnatiori had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; sor lhough he attempted lo ask ooncerning Lord Rulhven, the name hung upon hls lips, and he could not succeed in goining information. He went a few nights afl er with his ſister to the assembly of a near relati0n. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recoss, and there gaue himself up to his own devouring thaughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leauing, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get riear her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, ond revealed to him those features he most abborred. He sprang forwclrd, seized his sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced hcr towards the street: at the door he f0und hlmself impeded by the crowd of servanls who wcre waitingfor tbeir lords; and while he was engaged in pclssing them, he again heard that uoicewhifper c1ose to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He djd not dare lo turn, but, hurryirig his sister, soori reached home.\nAvbrey became a1moft djstractod. If before bis mind had beenabsorbed by one subject, how much more complctely was it cngrossed, now that the certainty of the m0nfter's livjng again pressed upon his thoughts. His slster'ſ attentioris were now unheoded, and it was jn vain that she intreclted him to explain to her whathad caused his abrupt conducl. He only uttered cl few words, and those terrified her. Thc more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath stclrtled hirn;—was he then to allow this monster ta roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst allhe held dear, and nat avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But evcn jf be wcre to break his oalh, and disclose hjs svspicions, who would beliove hjm? He thought of employing his own band to free thc world from such a wretch; but declth,he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; fhut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate on1y wben his sister c ame, wh0, with eyes streaming with tears, bcſoughl him, for her sake, lo support nature. At last, no longer cclpable of bearing stillnesſ arid solilude, he left his houso, roamed from ſtreet to street, anxious to fly that lmage which haunted him. His dresſ becaine negleeted, and he wandered, as oftonexp0sed to the noon-day sun as to the inidnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at laſt he laid him dowri to rest wherever fatigue overtook hiin. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced 6y him who fled from a pursucr fwiftcr than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea thclt he left by his absence the whole of his frjends, with a fiend amongst them, os whose presence lhey were unconsclous, ho determined to enter again into society, and walch him closcly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his 0ath, all wb0m Lord Ruthven approacbed with intimacy. But when he cntered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks wcre so ſtriking, his inwclrd sbudderings so visible, that hif sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongIy. When, howeve r, remonstrance proved unavailirig, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that hls mind was becoming alien ated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whicb had been before imposed upon them by Auhrcy's parents.\nDesirovs of saving him srom the injuries clnd fuffcrings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of proventing him from exposing to the general eye tbose marks of what they considered foIly, lhey engaged a phyſiciari to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so comp1etely was his mind abforbed by one terrible svbject. His inc0berencc became at last so great, that he was confined to hischamber. There he would often lie f0r days, incapable of being roused. He hcld become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affeclion and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tho entry os his ſister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to louch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love for me is ought, da not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only onswer was, \"True! true!\" and agclin ho sank into aslate, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: graduolly, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences beeome less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a porlion of its gl0om, whilst his gvardians observed, that several times in lhe day he would counl upon his fingers a definite number, and thon smile.\nThe tjme had riearly clapsed, when, uponthe last day of the ycar, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converſe with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was goirig nexl day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiausly to whom. Glad of this mark of returning jntellect, of wbich they feared he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of lhe Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was cl young Earl whom he had met with jn socjety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intentlon to be present at the nuptialſ, and desiring to see his sistor. They answered riot, but in a few minutes his sistor was with him. He was opparently again copable of being affectcd by the influerice of her lo vely smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at tbe thought of her brother's being once more aliue to the feelings of asfection. He began lo speak with oll his wonted warmth, and to eongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished sor rank and every accomplishment; wheri he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholdirig the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a parox-\nysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the reſemblonce of her future bvsband, he loo ked as if he djd not understarid her—then sejzing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenarice, he bade her swear that sho wouId never wed this morister, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed cls if that voiee again bade him remcmber his aath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Rutbven was riear hirn but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knces to them, he implored, he bogged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributirig this to the insanity thcy imagined had taken possession of hismind, endeavoured to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven had called tbe morning aster the drawing-room, and had boeri refuſed with evory one else. When he heard of Auhrey's ill health, he readily understood himsclf to be the couso of it; bvt when ho learned that he wcls deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardIy be concealed from thoſe among whom he had gained this informatian. He hastened to tbe house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great offection for the brother and interesl in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Mifſ Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had darigers and l oils to recount—could speak af himself as 0f an individua1 having no sympathy witb any being on thc crowded earlh, save withher to whom he addressed himsels;—could tell how, since he knew ber, his existencc, had begun to seem worthy of preservatiori, if it were merely lhat be might listeri to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such waſ the will of sate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtclined ari important embassy, which served as an excuſe for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her 6rother's deranged state,) which was to lake place the very day before his departure forthe continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen clnd paper; it was given him; he wrote o letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happine-\nsſ, her own honour, and the hanour of those now in the gravo, who onoe held her in thejr arms as their hope and thehope of thcir house, to delay but for a few hours that mclrriage, on which hc denounced thc most heavy curses. The servants promised lbey would deIiver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought il better not to harass any more the mirid of Miss Aubrcy by, what heeonsidered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without restto the busy inmates of the house; clnd Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceiued than des cribed, the notes of busy preparatlon. Morning came, and the sound os carriages hroke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcaine their vigilance, tbey gradually stolc away, leaving bim in thecustody of an helpless old woinan. He seized the opporlunlty, wjtb one bound was ovt of the room, and in a momenl found himself in the aparlmcnt where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first lo perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from tho room, speechless with rage. Wheri on the stcllrcaso, Lord Rulhven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, yaur sister is dishonovred. Women arefrail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his altendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come ln search of him. Aubrey could no longer support hlmself; his rage not finding vent, had braken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present wbcn he entered, as the physjcian was afraid of agitating her. The rnarriage was solemnized, ond the bride clnd bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increaſed; lhe effusi0n of blood produced sympt0ms of the near approach of doath. He dcsired his sister's guardians m ight be called, and wben the midnight haur had struck, he relaled composedly what the reader has perused—he died immedialely after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Misf Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was tao late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, arid Aubrey's sister had glutted tbe thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tbe world was all bofore him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his gvide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on boord one of his Majesty's vessels, iri the year 1812, we put into the harbour af Mitylene, in the is1and of that name. The bcauly of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, jnduce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though jt Iies rather out os the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Wo landed; as ufuaI, at the bottom of thebay, and whilst the men werc employed iri watering, and the purser bargainingfor cattle wilh the natlves, the clergyman and mysels took a ra mble to tho cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been bef0re. Dn the brow os Mount Ida (a smoll monticvle so named) we mct with and engaged a young Greekas 0ur guide, who told uf he had eome from Scio with an English lord, who left the island fourdays previous to our arrival jn his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said lheGreek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to qvit Milylene, wbero I am likely lo get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hlll, facing the river, belongs to him, arid he has Ieft an old man in charge of it: he gaue Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currericy,) ond has resided there ahout fourteen months, thaugh not eonstantly; for he sails inhis felucca very often to the differenl islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost n0 time in hastening to the housowhere our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by cln old man, who conducted us ouer the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-sloor—an entrance haIl, a drawing-room, a sitting parl0ur, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were al1 sirnply decorated: plain green-slained walls, mclrble tables on ejther side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountairi berieath, which could be made to p1ay through the brancbes by moving a spring fixod in the side os a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a largc eouch or sofa coinplcted the furnilure. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there werc no mirrors, nor a slngle pclinling. The bedchclmber had merely a large mattress spread on the sloor, with two stufsod cotton quiltf anda pillow—the cammon bed lhroughout Greece. In the sitting-room we obferved a rnarblo recess, formerly, the old man told us, fillod with books and papers, which were then in a Iarge seaman's ohestin the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contenls. Dn the tob lel of the recess lay Voltairo's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousſeau's works completc; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmcrman, in the German language; Klopſtock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English bo0k of ariy description. Most of these books were fil1ed with marginal riotes, wrjtten with a pencil, in Italian and Lcltin. The Messiab was literally scribbled all over, arid marked wjth slips of paper, on which alsowere remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The Iord had been reading these books the evening besore he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said ho, \"there they must lie untjl his roturri; for he is so particular, that were I to mave ane lhirig without orders, he would frown upori me for a week together; he is otberways very good. I once did him aservice; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of takjng caro af il, except twenty zech ines which I pay to an agcd Armenian who resides in a srnall cottclge in the wood, and whom the lord broughl here froin Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanceof thcbouse externally was pleasing. The portic0 in front was fifty pacef long and fourteen broad, and the f1uted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work comioes, (as it is now customary iri Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath cln owning of ftrong coarse linen. M0st of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, dririking ligbt winos, such as \"lacbryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying tbe euening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we eritered tbe house, a small streamlot glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woaden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenirigs and nights till twelve o'clack, roading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" soid the aId man, \"praying\" for he was very dovout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from thls seat was what may 6c termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye lo Mo urit Calcla, covered with olive arid myrtle trees in bIoom, and on tho summit of which an anciont Greek temple oppeclred iri majestic de cay. A sma ll stream issujng from the ruins descended in broken caſcades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sca smootbas glafs, arid an harizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninates tbe view in frorit; and a little on the lest, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, seueral small islonds were diftinctly obscrved, studding the light blue wave wilh spots of emerald green. I seIdom enjoyed a uiew moro than I did this; but our enqu-\niries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in thiſ romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wha had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" soid our conduotor, \"could tell, 6ut I am sure he will not,\"—\"And canriot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had nol time to uisit the Armenion, but on our return to lhe town we learnt several partioulors of the isolated lord. He had portioned oight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even daneed with them at the nuptial feast. He gclve a cow to one man, horfes to others, and colton and silk to the girls who 1ive by weauing these articles. He a1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the paor ohildren. In short, he appeared to uſ, srom all we collocted, to have beeri cl very ecoentric clnd benevolent character. One circumstance we leamt, which our old friend at the cottoge lhought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had 6ought her a piario-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with whlch we departed from the peaceful isle of Mjtylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guesſing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy 0f disposition, and oll those eccentricities whleh rnark peculiar genius. Arrivod at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling jn company witb Mr. FOSTER, thc architect, o pupil of WYATT'S, wha had been trovelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said be, \"clbout whom you are fo anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him cll Milylene.\" We hcld never tben heard of his lordship's fclme, as we had 6ecn some yoars from hoine; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put int0 our hands we recognized the recluse of Ca1cla in every page. Deeply did we regrel not havirig been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of relurning t0 Mitylene ori some future day; but to me that day will novcr rcturn. I makc thls statement, believlng it not quite unjnteresting, and in justioe to hjs lordship's good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associalingwith humari nature, or contribuling in any way to sooth its sorrowf, or add to its pleasures. Tbe fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdolef. All the finer feelings of the hoart, so elegantly dcpieted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose af solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a bei ng ori whose hoarl Religion hatb set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her inantle. N0 man can read thepreceding pleasing \"traits\" withovt feeling proud of him as a countrymon. With respect to his l0vcs or pleasures, I do not assume a right to giuo an apinion. Reports are ever to 6e received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral iritegrity; and he who dares juslify himself before that awful tri6unal where all must appear, alone may consvre the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun thcworld's applause, is tbe surest testimony of a virtuous heart and sels-approving confcience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printcr, Crown-court, Floet-street.",

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori\nTHE superſtition upon which thiſ tale is fourided is very general in the East. Among the Arabians il appears to be common: it did nat, however, extend itseIf to the Greeks uritil after the estclbliſhment of Christianity; and il has only assumed its present farm since the division of the Latin and Greek ohurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wondorful stories, still extont, of lho dead rising from tbeir graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight voriat ion, all over Hungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorroine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightIy imbibed a certain portion of the blood of thoir victimſ, who became emaclaled, lost their strength, and spcedily died of consumptions; whilst thefe buman blood-suckers fattened—and thcir veins became dislended to such astate af repletion, as to cause the blood ta flow from all the passagos of lheir bodies, and cven from the very pares of their skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, oredible account os a porticular case os vampyrism, which is stated to bave occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appeors, tbat upon an exomination of the commander-in-ehief and magistrotes of the place, they positively and unclnimously asfirrned, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, namcd Arnold Paul, had beeri heclrd to say, that, at Cassouia, on the froriticrs of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormentod by a vompyrc, but had found a way to rid himself os the evil, by eating soine of the earth ovt of the vampyre's grave, ond rub6ing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, dld not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hirnself; sar, about twenty 0r thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of having been lormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been depriuedof 1ifc by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitonts hauing consulted their Hadogni, took up tbe body, and found it (as is supposed t0 be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptiori, and emitting at thc moulh, nose, and ears, pure and florid 6lood. Pr oof having been thus obtclined, they resorted to the accustomed rem edy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported t0 have cried out as dreadfu1ly as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his hody, and threw the ashes inta his grave. Tbe same moosures were adoptod with the corses of those porsons who had previovsly died from vampyrism, Iest they should, in their turn, become agentf upori others who survived lhem.\nThe universal belief is, lhat a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in hls turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because lt seoms hetter adapted to illustrate the subicct of tbe prescnt observations than any ot her instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Groece il is considered as a sort of pvnjshment after dealh, for some hein0us crime committed whilst in exislence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his inserncll visitatlons solely to those beings he loved most whilc upon earth—those to whom be was bound by ties af kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to iri the \"Giaour.\"\nBul first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from jts tomb bo rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And ſuck the b1ood of all thy race; Thcre srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streclm of life; Yel loatbe the banquet which persorce Must feed thy livid living corse, Tby victiins, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing lhem, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. Butane lhat for thy crime mvst faIl, The youngest, beft beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a fothor's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yel thou muſt end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's lasl spark, And the last glafsy glance must view Whieh freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Theri wjth unhallowed hond shall tear The tresseſ of her yellow hair, Of whlch, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledgo was worn— But now is borne away by thee Momorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashlng tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—clnd with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in harror shririk away From spectre more accursed than thcy.\nMr. Southey bas also i ntroduced in bis wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arablan maid Oneiza, wh0 is represented as baving returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting bim sho best loved whiIst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout tho whole of thetale as a coinplete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long aooount in his travolf of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to bave been ari eyewitness; ond Calmet, in his greal work vpon this subject, besides a variety 0f aneodotos, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a cIassical, af we1l as barbarian error.\nMany curiovs and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition mlght be added; though the preſent rnay suffice for the limits of a noto, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, lhat though the term Vampyre is the one in most genercll acceptcllion, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in varlous parts of lhe wor1d: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the rnidst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, lhere appea-\nred ot the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his sirigularities, thcln hjs rank. Ho gazed upon the mirlh around him, as if he could n0t parlicipate thercin. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair 0nly attracted his attention, thal he might by o look quell it, and throw foar into tbose breasts where thoughtlcsfness reigned. Thoso who felt this sonsation of awe, could not explain whence it clrose: sorne altributed it to the dead grey eye, wh ich, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to piorce through to the iriward workings of the heart;bul fell upon the cheek witb a leaden ray that weighcd upori the skin it could not pass. His peouliarities caused him lo be invited to every house; all wished to soe him, and those who had beeri accustomed to violent excltement, and now fell the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagirig their attenlion. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint,cithcr from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outllne were beavtiful, mclny ofthe female hunters after n otoriety attempted lo win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of whal they might term affection: Lady Morcer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marrlage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mounte6ank, to attract his notice:—though in voin:—when she stood before him, though his eyef were apparently fixed upan her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—evenher unappalled impudonce was bafflod, and sho left the field. But lhough the common adultress could not influence even the guidanee of his eyes, jt was not that the female sex was indifserent to him: yet such was thc apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He bad, however, lhe reputationof a winning tonguo; and whelher it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was as often among tbose females who form the boast of their fex from their domestio virtues, as among lhose who sully it by their vices.\nA6out the same time, there came to Lo ndon cl young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with an only sister in the possessi0n of great wealtb, by parents who died whlle ho was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquiſhed the more lmportant charge os his mind to the care of rnercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feelirig of honour and candour, whicb dally ruinſ so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all tosympathise with virtue, and tbought that vice was thrown in by Provldenoe merely for the pjcturesque effecl of tbe soene, as we see in romances: he thought that tbe misery of a cottagc merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but whi ch were betteradapted t0 the pairiter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the reolities os life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasonf, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which sbould describe with least trulh their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightenjng countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into salse notians of his ta1ents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tollow arid wax candlcs that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation ln real life sor any of that congeries af pleasing pictures and descriptions conlained in those volumes, from which be had formed his study. Finding, however, some compcnsation in his gratified vanity, he was aboul to relinquish his dreamf, when the extrclordinary being we have abovc described, crossed him in his career.\nHe walched hiin; and the very impossihility of forming on idea of the charactor af a man eritirely absorhed in himself, who gaue few other signs of hiſ 0bservation of extornal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: a1lowing his imagination to picture eucry thirig lhat flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, hc soon formed this object into tbe hero of a romance, and determincd to 0 bserve the 0ffſpring of his faney, rather than the person before him. He became acqvainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far clduanced vpon his notice, thot his presence was aIways recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthueri's affoirs were embclrrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, lhat he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular charaeter, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardiaris, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necefsary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the caroer of vicc towards putting themselves upon cln equality with lhe aged, and not allowing thern to appear as if fallen frorn the skies, whcriever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of prajse, occording to the degree of skill shewri in carrying lbem ori. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such o mark of esteem from hirn, who, apparently, had nothing in co mmon with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they hcld passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunily of stvdying Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he found, th at, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the resvlts offered different ooriclusions srom the apparent motives to his conduct. His companjon was profusc in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond,and the bcggar, received from his hclnd more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey cauld not avo id remarking, that lt was nol upon thc virtuous, reduced lo indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he beftowed his alms;—these were sent from the door wilh hardly svppresſcd sneerſ; but when the prafligatc came to ask something, not to rclieve his wants, but to aIlow him to wa1low in his luft, or to sink him ſtill deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the grealer importunity ofthe vicious, which generalIy prevai ls over the retiring bashfulness of the virtu0usindigent. There was ane circumstance about the cbarity of his Lordship, which was still more impreſsed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found tbat there was a curse upon jt, for they were all either led to the scaffold, 0r sunk to the loweft and the most abject misery. At Br ussels clnd other towns through wbich they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagcrness with which his companion sought for lhe centres of all fashjonab1e vice; lhere he entered into all tho spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled wilh svccess, except where the kriown sharper was his anlagonist, ond then he lost euen more than he goiried; but it was always with the sclme unchanging face, with which he generally watched the sociely around: it was not, however, so whon he encounlered the rafh youthful novico, or the lu ckless father of a numerous family; then his very wiſh seemed fortune's law—tbis apparent abstractedness os mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with morc fire thcln that of the cat whilst dallying with lhe balf-dead mouse. In every town, he left the sormerly asfluent yo uth, torn from the cjrcle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dvngeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fjend; whilst many a father sat fraritic, amidst tho speaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single sarthing of hiſ late immenfe wealth, wherewith to buy overi sufficient to salisfy their present cravirig. Yct he took rio money fr0m the garnbling table; but immedlately losl, to theruinor of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the irinocent: this might but be lhc result ofa certain degree of knowledge, which waf not, howev er, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to repreferit tbif to his friend, and bog him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend lo his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him soine opportunity 0f speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his oarriagc, and amidst thc various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; ond though Aubrey was near the object of his curiofity, be obtained no groater gratification srom it than the constant exoitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hif exalted lmaginationbegan to asfume the appeararice of something supernotural.\nThcy soon arrived at Rome, arid Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companion; he lest him in daily attendarice upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he wenl in search of the mernorials of another a1most deserted city. Whilsl he was thvs engaged, letters arrived from England, whicb he openedwitb eager impaticnce; the first was from his sister, breathing nolhing but afsection; lhe others wcre from his guardians, the latter ast0riished him; if it had before entored irito his imaginatlon thatlhere was an eullpower resjdent in his companlon, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately lcaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vioious, for that the pofsesſion of irresistibIe powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to sociely. It had boen discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enbancehis gralificatiori, that his victim, the partner of hiſ guilt, ſhould be hurled from tho pirinacle of unsullied uirtve, down to thc lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom hc had sougbt, apparently on accourit of their virtue, had, since hjs departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expofe the whole deformity of tbelr vices to tbe public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon Ieaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on wbich to rest tbe eye. He resolvod to invcnt fome plausible pretext for abandoning him altogelher, purposing, in the rnean wbile, to watch him moro closely, and to let no slightcircumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered int0 the same circle, and ſoon perceived, lhat his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperierice of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seIdom that an unmarried female is mel with in soclety; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fol10wed him in all his windings, clnd soon djscovered that clri assignation had been appointed, whlch would most likely end in lhe ruin of an irinocent, though th0ughtless girl. L0sing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, arid abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, inf0rming him at the same time thal he was aware 0f his being ahaut to meet her that very nlght. Lord Ruthven answered, lhat his jntontions wero sueh as he svpposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed wbether be intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writingo note, lo say, thot fr0m that momerit he must decllne accompanyirig his Lordship in tho remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seck other apclrtments, and calling upon tbe motber of the lady, informed her of alI he knew, not only with regard to hcr daughter, but also concerning the characler of his Lordsbjp. The aſsignation was prevented. Lard Ruthuen next day mere ly sent hif servant to notlfy his complete assent to a scparation; but did nol hint any suspicion of his plans having boen foiled by Aubrey's iriterposltion.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crosſing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek;and soon occvpied himself in lracing the faded recards of ancientgIory upori monuments lhat apparently, ashamed of cbronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Undcr the same roos as himself, exislcd a beirig, so beauliful and delicate, that she migbt have formed the model for a painter wlshing to povrtray on canvass the promifed hope of the failhful in Mclhomet's paradjse, saue thot hcr eyes spoke too mvch mind f0r any one t0 think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along tbe mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typc 0f hor beavtics; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparenlly tbe eye of animated riature, for that sleepy luxurious loak 0f the animal suited but t0 the taste of cln epicure. The light ſtep of Ianthe often accomponied Au6rey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged jri the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the wholebeauly of her forin, floating as it were upon the wind, to thc eager gaze of him, who s0rgot the letters he had just decyphcred upon an aImost effaced tablet, in the c0ntemplati0ri of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted araund, exhibit in the sun's ray svch delicately brilliant and swif tly fad ing hves, it might wellexcuso the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the vory object he had before thaught of vital importance to the proper inlerprelalion of a passagein Pausclnias. Bul why attempt to describecharms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected hy erowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of whioh he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and walch the magic effects of his peneil, in tracing the scenes of her natiue ploce; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open pla in, would pclint, to him in all tbe glowing colours of youthfvl memory, the marriage pomp ſhe remembered viewlng in hor infaricy; and then, turning to subjects lhat had evidently madea greater impression upan her mind, would tell him al1 the supernatura1 tales os her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she to1d him the tale of the llving vampyre, who had passed years amidsl his friends, and dearcst ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fema1e to prolong his existence sor the ensuing months, his bl0od would run cold, whilst he atternpted ta laugh ber out of such id1e ond horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the riames os old men, who had clt last detected onc living ainong themselves, after soveral of their near relatives arid chjldren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend'f appetito; and when she found him so incredulouf, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked,that those who had dared to queslion their exjstence, always had some proof glvcn, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She dotailed ta him the traditioncll appeorance of these monsters, and his horrar was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descripti0n 0f Lord Ruthven;hc, however, still persisted in persuading her, lhat there cou1d be no truth in her fears, though at tho same time he wonderod at the many coiricidonces whichhad all terided to exci to a belief inthe ſupernatural power of Lord Rulhuen.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and inore lo Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all thc affected virtues of tho women clmong whom he had sought for hjs vision of romance, won his heart; arid while he ridiculed the idea of a young man os English habits, marrying an unedueated Greek girl, still he found himfelf more and more attaehed to the alm ost fairy form besore him. He would tear himsolf at tirnes fr0m hor, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return unlil his object was atlained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentian upon the ruins oround him, whiIst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possess0r of his thoughts. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile heing he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was beccluseshe had n0 longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite hounts, whilst her guardian waf occupied ln ſketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and tbey b0th,with several present, affirmed their existerice, pale with harror at tbe very name. Saon after, Aubrey determined toproceed upon one of bif excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; whon they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as hemust necessarily pclss through a wood, whcre no Greek would ever remajn, after tbo day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as tbe resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgjes, and donounced the most heavy evj1s as impending upon him who dorod to cross thcjr path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them sbudder at his daring thus to mock o superior, infernal power, the very name of wh ich apparently made their blood frecze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatt ended; he was surprised lo observe tbe meIancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that hls words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired thern with such terror. When he was a6out to depart, Ianthe caine t0 the fide of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to returri, ere night allowed tho power of these beingsto be pvt in actiori;—he promisod. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did riot perceive that dcly-lighl would foon end, and that ln the h0rizon there was one of those speckſ which, ln the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a trernendous inass, and pavr all lheir rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, howeuer, mounled his horse, detcrrnined to make up by speed for hjs delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these soulhern climates, is almost unknown; immediatcly the sun scts, night begins: and ere he had advariced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an jnlerval of rest—its thick hcavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilft the blue forked lightning seemed to fal1 arid radiate al his very feet. Suddenly his horse took frigbt, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entarigled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, lhat he was iri the neighbourhood of a bovel lhat hardly lifted itself up frorn the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approa-\nched, boping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain she1ter from the peltirig of the storm. As he approachod, the tbunde rs, for a moment silent, allowed him to hoar the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifIed, exultant m0ckery of cl laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: bul, roused by the thunder whjch agairi rolled over his bead, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found hjmself ln utter darkness: the s ound, however, guided him. He was appclrently unperceived; for, though be called,still the sourids cantinued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, wham he immediately seized; when a voicc eried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh fucceeded; and he selt himself grappled by one whase strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force againstthe ground:—his enemy threw himself upon hiin, and knceling upon hjs breclst, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the gIare of mclny torches penctrating through thc hole lhat gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rosc, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heord. The storm was riow still; and Aubrey, jncapable of mouing, was soon heard by those without. Tbey entered; the lighl of their torcheſ fell upon the mud walls, and the thalcb loaded0n every individual strawwith heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had altracted bim by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what wcls his horror, whcn the ljght of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive lhe cliry form af his fair conductress brought in a ljfelefs corse. He shut bis eyes, hoping that it was but a visiori arisjng fromhis dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, strelched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillriess abovt her sace that seemed almosl as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throal were the marks 0f teeth hauing opened thc vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultclneousIy struck wilh borror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyrc!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy vifions, now fallen with the flower of Iifo that had died withiri her. He knew not what hls thougbts were—hif mind was benumbed and seemed to ſhun refloction, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconscioufly in his harid a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. Thcy were soon met by different parties wbo had been engaged ln the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they appraached the eity, forewamed the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To dcscribe thoir grief wou ld bc impossible; but when they ascerlajned tho cause of their child's doath, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed tothe corse. They were incons0lablo; both died broken-heclrted.\nAubrey being put to bed wcls seized wlth a inost violent fever, and was osten delirious; in the so intervals he wouId call upon Lord Rulhven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountoble combinalion he ſeemed to beg of his former c0rnpanion to spare the being he lovcd. At othor times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at thif time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive,upon hearirig of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his const ant atteridant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he wcls borrjfjed and starlled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined witb that of a Vclmpyre; bvl Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implyjng a1most repentance sor the fault that had caused their separation, and fti1l rnore by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showcd, soon reconciled him tohis presence. His lordship feemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; bul as soon as his convalescence 6egan to be rapid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference srom the former man, except tbat at tjmeshe was svrprised to meet his gaze fixcd intently upon bim, with a smile of malicious exuItatjon playing vpon his lips: he knew n0t why, but tbjs smi1e haunted him. Durlng the last ſtage os the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engagcd in walching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking tbe progress os thoſe orbs, circIing, like our world, thc moveleſs sun;—indeed, he appeared lo wisb to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's inirid, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elastjcily as spirit which had once so distinguished him now feemed to have fled for ever. Ho was now as much a lover of solitude and silenco as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it in thc neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he bad formcrly frequented, Iarithe's form stood 6y bis side—if he sought it in the woods, bcr light step would appear wanderirig amidst tbe underwood, in queft of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rourid, would show, to his wiId imagination, her pale face and wounded tbroat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of whjcb crealed such bitter associotions in his mjnd. He proposed to Lord Rvthven, to whom heheld himself baund by the tender care he hcld taken of hjm during his lllness, that they ſhould visit those partſ of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but tbough they thus bastened from place t0 pIace, yet they seemed not lo heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight tbese reports, which they lmagined were ori1y the inventjon of individuals, whofe interest it was to excite tbe gcnerosily of those whom they defended from pretended darigerſ. In consequerice of lhus neglecting the advice of the inhabitarits, on one occasion they travelled witb onlya few guards, more to serve as guidcs than as a defence. Upon entering, howover, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whicb was tho bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from thc neighb0uring precipices, they had reafon to repent their riegligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in tbe narrow pclss, when thcy were startled by tho whistling of bvllets close lo their heads, and by the echoed report af several guns. In an instant their gvards had left them, and, plclcirig themselveſ behind rocks, had begun to fire in tbe direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their exomple, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn 0f the defile: but ashamed of being thus detairied by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and beirig exp0sed to unresisting slaughter, if any of lhe robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at 0nee to rush forward in search of the cncmy. Hordly had they lost the shelter of the rock, wben Lord Rulhuen receivod a shot in the shoulder, which broughl hlm to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was s0on surprised by seeing the robhers' foces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up thelr arms and furr endered.\nBy promises of greclt reward, Aubrey soon induced them ta convey his wounded friend to a neigbbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their prcsencc—they being content merely to guard the ontrance lill their comrade should retum with the promised surn, sor which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and declth seemed aduaricing with haſty stcps. His conduct and appeararice had not changed; he seemed as unconsciouf of pain as he had been os the objects abaut him: but towards the close of the last evcning, bis mirid became apparently uneasy, and his eye ofteri flxed upori Aubrey, wbo was induced to offor his assistarice with more thcln usual earnestness—\"Asslst me! you may save me—yov inay do more than tbat—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existcnce as little as that of the passing day; 6ut you may save my honour, your friend's hanour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my lifeebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if yov wovld concecll all y0u know of me, my honour were free from stainin the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall nat be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying mari, raising himself with exultarit violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all y0ur nature fears, swear that, sor a year and a day you will riot impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to ony living being in ony way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—Hjs eyes seemed bursting from their fockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his piIlow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retircd to rest, but did not sleep;the many clrcumslances alteriding his acquairitance with this man roſe upon his mind, and be knew not why; when he remembered his oalh a cold shivering came over bim, as if from the preseritiment of samething horrible awailing him. Rising early in lhe morning, he was about to enter the hovel in wbich he had left thc c orpse, when a r0bber met hirn, and informed him that it wos no longer there, having been conveyed byhimſelf and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinac1e af a neighbouring movnt, according to o promise they had given his lordshlp, that it should be exposcd to the first cold ray of tbe moon tbat rose after his deatb. Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several of lhe men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it 1ay. But, when he bad mounted to the summit he found no trace ofeitber the corpse or the clothes, though the rob6ers fwore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered ln conjectures, but be at last returned, convinced that they had buried lhe corpse f0r the fake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terribIe misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heigbten lhat superstitious melaricholy that had seizedupon his mlnd, he rcsolved to leove it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While wailing for a vessel to corivey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging tbose effects hehad with bjm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongſt olher things tbere was cl case containing several weapons of offence, more or lefs adapted to erisure the deatb of the victim. There wero scveral daggers clnd atoghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining lheir curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath clpparently omamented in lhe same style as the dagger discovered in the fatcll hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discavered tbat it fitted, though peculiorly shaped, the sheath he held in his band. His eycs seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bovnd to the d agger; yet still he wifhed to disbelleve; but tho particular form, the saine varyingtints upon the hoft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left rio room for doubt; there were also dropf of blood on each.\nHo loft Srnyrna, and on his way home, at Rorne, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to sriatch from Lord Ruthven's ſeductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortunc ruined, and she had not been heard of sincc the depclrture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had sclllen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He becamo morose and silent; and his orily accupation conſisted in urging the speod of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived clt Calclis; a bree2e, which seemed obedient to his wi1l, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his falhers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraccs and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine careſses, had gained his afsection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still morc attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of thot light brilliancy which only exists in tbe heated almosphere of a crowded apartrnenl. Her blue eye was ncver lit vp by the levlty os the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it wbich did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from ſome feeling within, that appeclred to indicate a soul consoiousof a brighter re alm. Her step waſ not that light footing, which strayſ where'er a butterfly or a co1our may attract—it was ſedate and pensive. When alone, her sacc was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed lo her his affection, and would in her presencc forget those griefs she knew deslroyed hjs rcst, who wauld have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed aſ if those eyes,—that face were then playjng in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe was yet anly cighteen, arid hod not been presented to tho world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he rnjght be her prolector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which wasfast approacbing, should be the epoch of hcr eritry into the \"busy scerie.\" Aubrey wovId rather havc remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed upon the meloncholy which overpowered him. He could not feel intercst abo ut the frivolities os foshionablc strangers, when his mind bcld been so lorn by the events he had witnessed; but he determi ned to sacrifioe his own comfort to lhe proteclion of his sislor. They soon arrived in tawn, and prepared for the next day, which had been onnounced as a drawing-room.\nTho crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had nol been held for a long time, and all who wero anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, haslened thither. Aubrey wasthere with his sister. Wbile hc was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all arou nd him, engaged jn the romembrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that uery place—he felt himself suddenly sei2ed by the arm, arid a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember yaur oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blost him, when be perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notjce on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed tlll his lirnbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was ob1iged to take the arm os a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced lhe room with hvrried steps, and fixod his handf upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burſting froin his brain. Lord Ruthven again befare him—circumstancef startod up iri dreadful array—the dagger—bis aath.—He roused himse1f, he couId not bolieve it possible—the dead riſe again!—He thought his imagination had conjvred up lho imclge his mind was resting upon. It was imp0sſible that it eould be rea-\nl—he determined, therefore, to ga again into society; for though he altemptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his llps, and he cauld n0t sucoeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leavjng her under the prolection 0f a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to hiſ own dev0uring thoughts. Pcrceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another r0om, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest eonversation; he attempted to pasſ and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turried round, and revea1ed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arin, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: al the door he foundhimself impeded by the crowd os servants who wcre waitirig for their lords; clnd while he was engaged iri passing them, he again heard that voice whifper olose to him—\"Remcmber your oath!\"—He did not daro to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey beeclme alinost diftracled. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more c0inpletely was it engrossed, now that lhe certainty of the monster's living again presſed upon his thoughtf. His fister's alteritions were now unheedod, and it was in vajn that she intreated him lo explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrisied her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildercd. His aath slartled him;—waſ he tberi to a1low this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon hls broath, amidst allhe held dcar, and nol avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his ooth, arid disclosehis suspicionf, who would believc him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister cclme, who, with eyes streaming wilh tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street tostreet, anxiovs to fly that image wbich haunted him. His dress became rieglected, and he wandered, as often exposed lo the noon-day sun as to tbe midnjght damps. He was no longer lo he recognized; at first he returned with the evoning to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest whercver fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him wbo fled from a pursuerswlfter than any—from lhought. His conduct, however, suddenly changcd. Struck with the idea that he left by bis abserice the whole af his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they werc unoonscious, ho determined to enter again into society, and watch himcloscly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oatb, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with iritimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were ſo striking, bis inward shudderings so visible, that his sisler was at last obliged to beg of him to abslairi from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strorigly. Wheri, however, remonstrance proved unavailjng, the guardians thought proper to interpase, arid, foarjng thot bis mind was hecoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume agoin that trvst wblch had been hefore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirouf os saving him fromthe injvries arid susferings he hcld daily encountered in his wclnderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged cl physician to reside in the house, and take conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to riotice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so greot, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incclpable of belng roused. He had beeome emaciated, hjs eyes had attained a glassy luslre;—the only sign of clffection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tbe cnlry of his sister; then he would somotimes start, and, scizing her hands, with looks thal ſeverely afflicted her, he wauld desiro her not lo touch him. \"Oh, do nat touch him—if yourlove for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answcr was, \"True! true!\" ond again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. Thjs lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohorences became less frequent, and hif mind tbrew off a portion of its glooin, wbilſt his guardiaris observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fjrigers a definite numhor, and then fmile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upori the last day of tho year, oneof his guardians eritering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstarice of Aubrey's being in so clwful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the namc of the Earl of Marsden. Tbinking this was a young Earl wbom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonlshed them stjll mare by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to seo his sjster. They answered not, bul in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capoble of being affected by the irifluence of ber lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kifsed her cheek, wet with tears, flowingat the thougbt of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her vpon hor marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and overy accomplishmerit; whenhe ſudderily perceived a locket upon her breaſt; opening it, whclt was hls surprise at beholding the featuros of the monster who had so long jnfluenced his life. He seized tbe portrait in aparoxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upan her asking him wby ho thuf dcstroyed the resemblance ofher future husband, he looked as is he did not vnderstand her—then seizing hor hands, arid gazing on her wjth a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that sbe would never wed this monster, far he— But he could not aduance—it seerned as if that voice again bade him rernember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthvon wos near him 6ut saw no one. Iri lhe meantime the guardiaris and pbysician, wbo had beard the whole, and thought lhis was but a return of hiſ disorder, entered, and forcing him srom Miss Aubrey, desired her ta leavc hirn. He fell vpon his knoes to them, he iinplared, he begged of them ta delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken p0sseſsion of his mind, endoavouredto pacify him,and retired.\nLord Ruthven hcld ccllled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refufedwith every one else. Whcn hc heard of Aubrey 's ill hea1th, be rcadi1y understood himself to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultatiari and pleasure could hardly be coriceaIed from those among wham he had gained this inforination. He basteried to the house of his former companion, and, by coristant attendarice, and the pretence 0f great affection for the brother arid inlerost in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Misſ Aubrey. Who could resift his power? His tongue had dangers and toils t0 rocount—could speak of himself aſ of an individuol hclving no sympatby witb any being on the crowded earlh, sove with her to whoin he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had beguri to seem worlhy of preservation, if lt wore merely that he might lifton to ber soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well haw to use the serpent's orl, or such was lhe wllI of fate, that he gained hor affoctions. The litle of the elder branch falling at length to him, he 0btained an important embassy, which served as anexcuse for haſtening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's dorariged state,) which was to take plaoe the very day bef0re hif departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the pbysician and hif guardians, attempted to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter lo his fister, corijuring her, as she valued her own hoppiness, her own h0nour, and the honour of those naw in the grave, who once held ber in lhelr arrns as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hourſ thot marriage, on which he denounced the m0st heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it;but giving it to lhe physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Avbrey by, what he considered, the ravingf of a maniac. Night passod on without rest ta the busy inmates of the h0uso; and Aubrey heord, with a horrar thal may more easily be concelved than described, the notes 0f busy preparation. Morning carne, ond the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew cllmost frantic. Tbe curiosity of lhe servants at last overcame their vigilanoe, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helploss ald woman. He seized the opporturiity, with one b0und was out of the room, and jn a moment found himſelf ln the apartment where all were near ly assembled. Lord Rutbven was thefirst to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurrled him from the room, speeohless with rage. When an the staircase, Lard Rulbven wbispered in his ear—\"Remember yaur oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister js dishonovred. Women are frajl!\" So saying, he pushed him tawards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vont, had broken a blood-vossel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the pbysician wcls afraid of clgilating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroorn lest Loridon.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms os the near approach of death. He deslred his sister's guordians mighl be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Mjss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rvthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glullcd tho tbirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXT RACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESID ENCE, &c.\n\"The world wos all before bim, whcre to choose his place of rest, and Providcnce bis guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago,on board one of his Majesty's vesscls, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of thclt name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo ond vegctablcs aIwclys to be had therc, induce many Britishvessels to visit it—both men of war and mercharitrnen; and thovgh it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Srnyrna, its bourities amply repay for the devialion of a voyage. We landcd; as usual, at the bollom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and mysels took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, wbere we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so namod) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told vs he hod come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival ln hls felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; butI did not choose to qujt Mitylene, where I am likely to gct married. He was an odd, 6ut a very good man. The cottago over the hiIl, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old inan in charge of it: he gclve Dominick, lbe wine-trador, six hundred zechines for it,(a6out L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen monlhs, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to tbe different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haftening to the house where ourc0untryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, wh0 conductod us ouer tbe mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all fimply decoratcd: p1ain green-stairied walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrlle in the centre, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the brancheſ by moving a spring fixed ln the side of a smalI bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In tho hall stood balf cl dozen English cane chclirs, and an empty boak-case: there wero no mirrors, nor a single painling. The bedchamber had merely a large mattross spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common hed throughout Grcece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble rec ess, formerly, the 0ld man told vs, filled with hooks and papers, which were then in a lorgeseaman's chest in the closel: it was open, but we did not think ovrselves justified in oxaminlng the contonts. Ori the toblet of thc recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roussoav's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiclh; Kot2cbue's novels; Schiller's play of the R0bbers; Mi1ton's Paradise Losl, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from thc Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled wilh mclrginal riotes, written witb o pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was lilerally seribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, ori which also were remarks.\nTbe old man said: \"The lord bad bcen reading these books the evening beforo he sailed,ond forgot to place lhom with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until hls return; for he is so parlicular, that were I to move onething withaul orders, he would frown up0n me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a servicc; and I have the produce os this farm for tbe trouble of taklrig care of it, exccpt twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Arinenian who resides iri a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brougbt here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the h ouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty paces long and fourteen broad, ond the fluted marblepillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is riow customary in Greciari clrchitecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof,surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was couered by a fine Turkey corpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse Iinen. Most of tbc house-tops are thus furnished, as upori them the Greeks pass their evenings in smokirig, drinking light wines, ſuch as \"Iachryma christi,\" eclting fruil, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the hauſe, a small streamlet gIided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clvslering together on its borders, and under the shade 0f two large myrtle bushes, a rnarble seot with an ornamenlal wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many ofhis evenings clnd nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking ta himself. \"I suppose,\" said the oId man, \"p raying\" for he was very devout, \"and always ottended our church twice a week, bcsides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line 0f rich vineyards led lbe eye to Mount Ca1cla, covered with 0live and myrtle trees in 6loom, arid on lhe summit of which an ancient Greek tompIe appear od in majestie decoy. A small stream issuing fram the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was losl in the woods near the rnountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termlnates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands werc distinctly observed, studding the light bluewave with spots of emerald green. I seldomonjoyed a view more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitless os ta the name os thc person who had resided in tbis romanlic solitude: none knew his riame but Dominick, hif banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I clm suro he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" faid I—\"If I can,\" sald he, \"I dare not.\" We hod not timc to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we leclrnt several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had portioned elght young girls when he was last upon lhe island, and evcri danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving t hese articles. He also bought o new boot for a fisherman who had lost his awn in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments ta the poor children. In short, he appeared tous, from all we collected, to hove 6een a very ecceritrjc and bonevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper nol to diſclose. He hada most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen wolking on the sea-shore, and he had 6ought her a piano-forle, and taught her himself lhe use of it.\nSuch was the informatjon with which we departed from the peaceful islo os Mitylene; ovrimaginations all on tbe rack, guessing who thlſ rambler iri Greeoecould be. He had money it wcls evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities whieh mark pecu liar goniu s. Arrived clt Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archltect, a pupil os WYATT'S, who bad been trauelling in Egypt and Greece, \"Theindividual,\" faid he, \"ob0ut whom you are so clnxiouf, if Lord Byron; I mel him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I cllso visiled him al Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had becn some years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every pagc. Decply did we regret n0t having been inore curious in our researches at lhe cottage, but we consoled ourselves witb tho idea of rcturning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believlng it not quite uninteresting, and in justiceto his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse lo associating with human nature, or contri6uting in any way to sooth its sorr0ws, or add to lts pleasures. The fact is directly the reverso, as moy be plainly gathered fromthose Iittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of tbe heclrt, so eleganlly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his boſom. Tendemess, syinpathy, and charity appear to gulde all his acljons: arid his courting the repose of ſolitude ls ari additional r eason for markirig him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, arid over whose head Bencvolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a covntryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not afsume a right to give an opinion. Reports are cver to bc reeeived wilh caution, particularly when direoted against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsels before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censurelhe errors of o fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genlus. To d0 good jn secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest lestimony of a virtuouf heart and self-approving conscicnce.\nTHE END\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-streel.",

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Talo.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this taleis faunded is very general in the East. Amang the Arabiaris it appears to be eommon: it did not, however, extend itself to tbe Greeks until after the eslablishment of Christiariity; andit has only clsfumed its presenl form ſince the division of the Latin and Greek churchef; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, lhat a Latin body could not corrupt if buried ln their territory, it graducllly inoreased, and formed lhe subjectof many wonderful storios, still extant, os lhe deod rising srom their graves, and feeding upon the blood of tbe young and beautiful. In the West it sprecld, with some slight variation, ol1 over Hungary, Poland, Austrla, and Larraine, where the belies existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain porlion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of conſumptions; whllst these human blood-suckerſ fattened—arid their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodles, and even from the very pores of tbeir skjnf.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular oase of vampyrifm, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, jn Hungary. It appears, that upon an examinatlon of the c0mmander-in-chief and mclgistrates of lhe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, ahout five years before, a certain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, hod been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiersof the Turkish Servia, he had heen tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. Thjs precauti0n, however, did not prcvent him from becomjrig a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days afler his death and burial,many persons complained of having been lormented by him, arid a deposition was made, that faur personſ had been deprived af life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, tho inhabjtants having consulted tbeir Hadclgni, took up the b0dy,and found it (cls is svpp0sed to be usual incases of vampyrjsm) sresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emjtting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having becn thus oblained, tbey resorted to the accustomed reinedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to haue cried out as dreadfully as if he had been aljve. This done, they cul offhis head, burned his body, and threw lhe clshes inta his groue. The same measures wore adopted with the corscs 0f those persons who had previously djed from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turri, become agents upon othcrs wh0 survivod thein.\nThe universal belief is, that a pcrson suckedhy a vampyre bocomes a vampyre himsels, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bclilisf.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is bere related, bccause it soems better adapted t0 illustrate the subject of the prosent o6servations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greecc it is consldered cls a sort of punjshment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed lo vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties 0f kindred and affection.—A supposition alIuded to in the\"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse s hall fr0m its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the notive place, Andsuck the blood of alI thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet locltbe the bclnqvet which perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet oxpirc, Shall know the demori for their sire; As eursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flawerſ arc wjthered on the stem. But one lhat for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloued of all, Sholl bless thee with a father's name— That word shaIl wrap lhy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her oheek's 1ast tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Wbich freczos o'er lts ljfelesſ blue; Then with unhallowed hand shaIl tear The tresses of her yellow hair, 0f which, in lifo a lock when shom Affection's fondesl pledge was worn— But now is borne away by theo Memorial of thine ogony! Yet with thine own best blood shalI drip; Thy gnashing toolh, clnd haggard lip; Then stalking to lhy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afritſ rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed thcln they.\nMr. Southey has also iritroduced in his wild but beautiful p0em of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse os the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represerited as having returned froin thc grave for lhc purp0se of tormenting hlm she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have refulted from the sinfulness of her life, sbe being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale cls a complete type of purlty and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long acoount ln his travels of several astonishing cases 0f vampyrism, lo which he pretc-\nnds to hclve 6een an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great wark upon thls subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put fortb some learried djssertations, tcnding to prove it to be a classical, aswell as barbarian error.\nMany curlous arid interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; tbough the present may susfice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to cxplanatiori, and which may riow be concluded by merely remarking, that lhough the term Vampyre is the one in most generol acceptation, there are several athers synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happencd that in the midst of the dissipations attcndant upon a London winter, there appeared at tbe voriouſ parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, m0re remarkable for his singularities, than hjs rank. He gazed upan the mirth arovnd him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of tbe fair only attracted hif attention, that he might by a look quelI it, and throw fear into th0se breasts where thoughtlessriess reigned. Those who felt lhis sensation of awe, could not explain wherice it aroso: some attributed it t0 the dead grey eye, wbicb, fixing upon lhe object's face, did not ſeem to penetrate, and at one glarice to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His pecu1iaritief caused himto be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and tbose who hod been accustomed to violent excitemcnt, and now felt tbe welght of ennui, were pleased at hav ing something in their presence capoble of engaging lheir attention. In spite of tho deadly hue of his fac e, which nevor gclined a warmer tint, eitber from the blush of modesty, or from the strong omotion of passion, though its form arid ovtline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attomptedto win his attentions, and gain, at leclst, some morks of what they mlght lerm affection: Lady Morcer, who had beon thc mockery of every monster ſhewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw hersels in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, lo attracl bis notice:—though in vain:—when she stood bef0ro him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still jt fcemed as if they were vnperceived;—even her unappalled impudenco was baffled, and she left the field. But tbough the common adultross could nol influonce even theguidance of his eyes, it was not that the female ſex wasindifferent to him: yet such was theapparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and inn0cent daughter, that few know he ever addressed hiinself to females. He had, however,the repulation of a winning tongue; arid whether it was that it evori overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he wasas often among those females who form the boost of their sox from tbeir domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, therecame to London a young gontleman of tbe name of Aubrey: he was an orphanleft with an only ſister in the pofsession of g reat wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thovght it their duty merely to take care os his forturie, while theyrelinquished the more important charge of his mirid to the care ofmercenclry subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of banour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He beljeved all to sympat-\nhise with virtue, and thovght that uice was thrown in by Providence inerely for the picluresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vestlng as elotbes, which were as warm, but which were botter adapted to the painter's eye by their irrcgular fo1ds and uariovs coloured patches. He lhought, in fine, thclt the dreams of poets were the reclIities af ljfe. He was handsome, srank, and rich: for lbese roasons, upon hiſ entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the ſame time, by their brighteriing countenanceſ when he approclched, and by tbeir sparkling eyes, wben he apened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romance of his so1itary hours, he waf stortled at finding, tbat, except in the tallow and wax candleſ that flickered, nol srom lhe presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, lherc was no foundation iri real life for clny of that congeries os ple asing pictures and descriptions contained in those volurnes, from whioh he had formed his study. Findirig, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being wc havc above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossjbility of forming an ideo of the characler of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observatiori of external objects, than the lacit assent to their exislence, implied by the avoidarice of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this ob jecl into the hero of a romance, arid determined to obsorve lhe offspring of his fancy,rather than lhe person before him. He became acquainted with him, poid him attentions, and so for advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually lcarnt tbat Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon fourid, from the notes of preparatlan in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this fingu1ar character, who, till naw, had only wbetted his eurjosity, he hinted to his guardions, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the yaung to take some rapid steps in tbe career of vice towards putting themselues upon an equality with the aged, and not a11owing them to appear af jf fallen srom the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues ore menlioned as the subjeots of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying thcm on. They oonſented: ond Aubrey immediately mentioning hiſ intentions lo Lord Rvthven, was svrprised to receive from him a proposal lo join him. Flattered by such a mork of osteem fromhjm, wha, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepled it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubroy had had no opportunity of sludying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, tbat, though many more os his actions were expased to bis view, the resultsoffered diffcrent conclusions fram the a pparent motives to his conduct.His companiori was prosuse in bis liberallty;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, receivcd from his hand more than enough to rolieve their jmmediale warits. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the virluous, reduccd to indigence by the misfortunes ottendant even upon virtue, thal he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sncerſ; but when tbe profligato came to ask something, not to reljeve his wants, but to allow him to wallow iri his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was scnt away with rich charily. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importvnity of the vicjous, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulnefs os the virtuous indi gerit. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, whicb was slilI more impressed upon his mind: all those vpon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon il, for they were clll either led to the fcaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the rn0st abjecl misery. At Brussels and other towns tbrough wbi ch they passed, Aubreywas surprized ot the apparent eagerness wlth which his companion ſought for the cenlres of all fashjonable vice; there be enlered into aIl the spirit os the fara table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagoniſt, arid then hc lost everi more than he gained; but lt was always with the same unchanging face, wilh whjch he gerierally wcltchedthe fociety around: it waf not, however, so when he encovritered the rash youthful nouico, or thc lucklcss falher of a nvmerous family; theri his very wish scemed fortune's law—this oppareril abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled witb more fire than that of the cat whilst dclllying with lhe holf-dead mouse. In every town, ho left the former1y afflucnt youth, torn srom the circle be adorned, cursing, in the solitudc of a dungeon, the fate that hcld drawn him within thereach of lhis fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speoking looks of mute hungry childron, without a single farthjng of hif late lmmense weaIth, wberewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling toble; but immediately lost, lo the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just sriatchedfrom the convulsive grasp of thc innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capoble os combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity clnd pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day ho boped his friend wauld give him fome opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, and amldst the varl0us wild and rich scenes 0f nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his ouriosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the c0nstarit excitement of vairily wishing lobreak that mystery, which to his oxalted jmagination 6egan to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey far a time lostsight of his companion; he left him in daily attendanoe upon the morriing circle af ari Italian countess, whilst he went in searcb of the memorials of anothor alrnost desc rted city. Whilsl he was thus engaged, letters orrived from EngIand, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from bis sister, breathing nothing but affection; the otherſ were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into hls imagination that thore was an evil power residont in his compariion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfuIly vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, roridered his licentious habits m0re dangerous to society. It had been dlscovcred, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, thathis victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pjnnacle of vnsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss af infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had n0t scrvpled to cxpose the whole deformity 0f their vicef to the public gaze.\nAubrey det-\ncrmined upon leaving one, whose character had not yel shown a single bright poinl on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposirig, in the mean while, lo walch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstanoes pass by unnotjced. He enter ed into the sarno circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperiencc ofthe daughter of lhe lady whose hovse he chiefly freqvonted. In Itoly, it is seldom thclt an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obligcd to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all bis windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, thovgh thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered tho apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions withrespect to lhe lady, informing him cll the same tlme that be was clware of hif being aboutto meet her thclt very night. Lord Ruthven anſwered, that his intentions were sucb as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to mclrry her, mcrely laughed. Aubrey retircd; and, immediately writing a note, to say, thot from that moment he must decline accompanylng his Lordship in the remclinder of their proposed l0ur, he ordered hjs seruant to seek other apartmerits, arid calling upon the m0ther of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard lo her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. Tho assignation was prevcrited. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete asſent to a separation; bul did not hint any fuspicion af his pIans having 6een foiled hy Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greecc, arid crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in tho house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself iri tracing the faded records of ancient glory up0n monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltcring soil or many col0ured lichen. Under the same roof as hiinself,exiſted a being,so 6eautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvafs the promised hopeof the saithfvl in Mahomct's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much inind for any one to lhink she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountairi's side, one would have thought the gazeIle a poor type af her beauties; for who would haue exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animalcd nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the onimal suited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his searoh after antiquities, and often would the uncorisclous girl, engaged iri the pursuit os a Kashmere butterfly, show the wbole beauty 0f hcr form, floating as it were upon the wind, ta the eager gaze of bim, who forgot the letters he had just decyphcrcd upon an almost effaccd tablet, in the contempIation os her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as ſbe flitted around, exhibit iri the ſun'ſ ray such delicately brilliant and swjftly fading bues,it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who letescape from his mind thc very object he had before thought of vital importclnce to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why ottempt lo describe charrnswhich all foel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffeeted by crowded drawing-roams and stifling balls. Whilst he drew tbose remains of whicb he wished to preserve a mcmorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects os his pencil, in tracjng the scenes of her native placo; she would then describe to him the circlirig dance uponthe open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, lurning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, wou1d tell him all the supernaturaI tales of her nurse. Her carnestness and apparent belief af what she narrated, excited the iriterest even os Aubrcy; and often as she lold him the tale of the living vainpyre, who had passed years amidst his frjends, and dearest ties, forcedcvery year, by f eodjng upon the life af a Iovely female to pr0long his exlſtence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attcmpted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasics; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had clt last detected one living among themselves, after several of thejr near relatives and children had heen found marked with lhe slamp of thc fiend's appetitc; and when ſhe found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believo her, for lthad been, remarked, that those who had dared to qucstion their exiſtence, always bad ſomo proof given, whieh obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detaiIed to him thc troditional oppearance of these monsters, and hjs horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descriptian of Lord Ruthuen; he, however, still persisted in persuading ber, that there could be no truth in hor fears, though at lhe same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all lended to excite a belief in the fupernatvral power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach hiinself more and more to Ianthe; her lnnocence, so conlrasted with all tho affected virtuos af the women amang whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed lhe idea of ayoung man of English habits, marrylng an vneducated Greok girl, still he found hlmself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hjm. He would lear himse1f at timos from her, and, forming a plan for s0meantiquarian research, he would depart, deterrnined not to return untll his object was attoined; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilsl in his mind he retained an iinage thot seemed alone the rightfvl possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unoonscious of his love, and waſ ever the same frank infclnti1e being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; hut it was beeause ſhe had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourjto havnts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragmcnt which had yet escaped the destruetive band of time. She had appealed to ber parents an the suhject of Vampyres, and they both, wilh several present, affirmed their existence, pale wjth horror at the very name. Soon afler, Aubrey dotermined to proeeed upon orie of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when thoy heard the name of the p1aco, theyall at once begged of him not to returri at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, afler the day had closed, vpon any consideration. They described il cls the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnaI orgies, and denounced the most hoclvy evils as lmpending upori hjm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring tbus to mock a superior, inserrial power, the veryname of which apparerit1y madc their blood freeze, he was si1ent.\nNext inorning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he wof surprised to observe the melancholy face of his hosl, and was concerned to firid that biswords, mocking lhe belies of lhose harrjble fiends, had inspired them with such terror. Whenhe was about to doparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and eornestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power os these beings to be put in action;—he promised. Hewas, howevcr, so occupied in bis research, that he did not peroeive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer c1imatcs, so rapidly gather into a lremeridous mass, and pour alI their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted bis horse, determined to make up by speed for bis delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in t hese southern climates, is almost unknown; jmmediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had odvanced far, the power of the storm was ab0ve—its echoing thundors had scarcely an interval of rcst—its thick heavy rclin forced its way through lhe conopying foliage, whilst the6lue forked lightning seeinod to fall and radjate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, 6y the glare of lightning, that he was jn the neighbourhaod of a hovel that bardly listed itself up from the rnaſses 0f dead leclves arid brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guido him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the starm. Af he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadsul shriekſ of a woman mingling with the ſtifled,exultanl mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost vnbroken sound;—he wasstartled: but, roused by the thunder which agoin rolled over hlf head, he, with a sudden effort, forccd opon the door of the hut. He found hiinself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparcntly unperceived; sor, though ho called, still tbe sounds continued, and no notice was tclken of him. He sovnd himself in contact with some one, whom he imme diately seized; when a voice cried,\"Again baffled!\" ta whicb a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: detormined lo seIl hif life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was ljfted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the grourid:—bis enemy thrcw himself upon him, and knecling upon his breast, hcld placed hiſ hands up0n his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole lhat gave light in thc day, disturbed him;—he inſtantly rose, arid, loaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in amoment the crashing of the brariches, as ho broke thr0ugh the wood, was rio lon ger heard. Tbe storm was now stil1; and Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by thoſe without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon thc mud walls, and the thatch loadcd on every individuaI straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they search ed far her who had attracted hjm by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his harror, when the light of the torches oneemore burst upon bim, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought jn a lifeIess corse. He shut hif eyes, hoping thatit wafbut a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the samc form, when he unclosed lbem, stretchod by his side. There was no colour upori her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stllIness about her foce thal seemed almost as attaohing as the life that once dwelt there:—upon ber neck and breast was b lood, and upan her throat were the marks of teelh having opened the vein:—to this the inen pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter waf quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid bythe side of her who had lately been to him lhe object of so mclny bright and fairy visions, now falleri with the flower os life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts wore—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he heId almost unconsciouſly in his hand a naked dagger os a particvlar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had beeri erigaged in the search of her whom a mother bod misſed. Their lomentable crie s, as they approachod the city, forewarned the parontſ of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe lheir grief wou ld bc impossible; but wben they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Avbrey, and pojnt ed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-bcarted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized wilh a most violont fever, and was often de1iriouſ; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable eombjnation he soemed to beg of his former companion to spare thebeing he loved. At othcr timos he wauld imprecato maledictions up0n hls head, and curse him aſ her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time t0 arrive at Athens, ond, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediatelyplaced himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from bis delirium, he wos horrisied and startled at the sight of him wh0se image he had now c0mbinedwith that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rutbven, by bis kind w0rds, implying almost repenlclnce sor the fault thot had caused their separation, and still more by lhe attentian, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to hls presence. His lordship seemed quile changed; he no longer appeclred that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again grodually retired into the same ftate of mind, and Aubrey pereeived no differe nce from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of rnalicious exultalion playing upon his lipſ: he knew not why, but tbis srnile hclunted him. During the lclst stage of tbe invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently ongaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breezc, or in inarking theprogress of thoſe orbs,circljng, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he a ppeared to wish to clvoid the eyos of all.\nAubrey's mind, by lhis sh0ck, was much weakeried, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have sled for ever.He was now as mucb a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bul much as he wished for solilude, his mind c0uld not find it in thc neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruiris he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if hc sought it in the woods, her llght ftep would appear waridering arnidft the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; thon suddenly turning raund, wovld show, ta his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assaciations in his mind. He pro posed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himfelf bound by the lender cclre he had taken of hiin during his illness, that they should vislt those parts of Greeee neitber had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a reeollection covld be attached: bul though they thus hastened from plaee to place, yet they seemed not to hoed what lhey gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, 6ut they gradually began to ſlight these reports, whichthey imagined were only tbo inuentiori of individuals, whose interest it was to oxcite the generosity of thase whom they defended fr0m pretended dangers. In consequence af thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one accasion they travelled with anly a few guclrds, more to serve as guides than as a defenco. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at tbe bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouririg precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; sor scarcely were the wh0le of the party engaged inthe narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets closo to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had lest them, and, placing tbemselves bohind rocks, hod begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven ond Aubrey, imitating lheir exainple, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: hut ashamed of being tbus detairied by a foe, who with insvlting shouts bade them advonce,clnd being exposed to unresisting s1aughter, is any of the robbers fhould climb abovc and take thom in tbe rear, they determined at once lo rvsh forward in search of tbe eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, whicb brought him to theground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, rio longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robhers' faces around him—hiſ guards having, up0n Lord Ru tbven's being wounded, iminediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey saon induced them to convey his wounded friend lo cl neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon cl ranſom, ho was no more disturbed by their presence—they being conlent merely to guard the entranee till their comrade should return with the promlsed sum, for whlcb he had an order. Lord Rutbven'f strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortifjcatiori ensued, and death seemed cldvclncing with hasty steps. Hls conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mind became opparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inducod to offer hiſ assistance with more than usual earneslness—\"Assist ine! you moy savo me—y0u may do more than that—I mean not my lise, I heed tbe death of my existenco as litlle as lhat of the passing day; but you may savo my honour, your sriend's honour.\"—\"How? tell mehow? I wauld do ony thlng,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but littlc—my life ebbs apaee—I canriot explain the whole—but if you would conceal a1l you know of me, my horiour were freo from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for s0me time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himse1f with exullant vlolence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by oll your nature fears, swear that, for a year anda day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatcver may happen, or whatever you may soe. \"—Hls eyes seemed bursting from tholr soeketſ: \"I swear!\" said Avbrey; he sunk laughing upon his pi1low, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retircd to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his inind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oalh a cold shivering came over him, as if from the pre sentiment of somethirig horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left tbe corpse, when a robber met him, and informed hiin tbat it was n0 longer there, having been conveyed 6y himſelf andcomrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neigbbouring mount, aceording to a promise thcy had given bis lardship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rase after his death. Avbrey astonished, and taking severa1 of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace af eitbcr the eorpse or the clothes, though the rabbers swore they pointed oul tho ideritical rock on whieh they had laid the hody. For a time his mind was bewildered in c0njectures, but he at laft returned, convinced that they had buried tbe corpse for the sakc of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in whjch he had rnet with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appareritly conspired to heighten lhal superstitious rnelanch0Iy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved lo leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him lo Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himselsiri arranging those effeets he had with himbelonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other thingſ there was a case conlaining several weapons of ofsence, more or less ada pted to ensure the declth of tho victjm. There were s everal daggers ond ataghans. Whilst tvrning tbern over, and examining their curiaus forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamenled in the same style as the daggor discovered in the fcltal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he fovnd the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when hediscovered that it filted, thavgh peculiarly shaped, the sheath he he1d in his hand. His eyef seemed to need no further certolnty—they seemod gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet ſlill he w ished to disbelieve; but the particular form, thc same uaryjng tints upon the haftand sheath werc alike in splendour on both,clnd left no roorn far doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and an his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were coriceming lhe lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their forlune ruiried, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey'smind becarne almost broken under so mclny repeated horrors; he was afraid tbat this lady had fallen a victim lo the destroyer of Ianthe.He becclme morose arid silent; and his only occupation consisted in vrging lhe speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save tbe life of some one he hold dear. He arrived at Ca1ais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and be hasteried to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momenl, appeared to lose, in the ombraces and coresses of his sister, all memory of the paft. If she before, by her infanline earesses, bad gained hiſ affection, now thal the woman began to appear, she was still more attaohing as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gajns the gaze and opplause os the drawing-room assemblies. There was nonc of that light brilliancy whlch only exists in the heated atmosphere os a cr owded apartmcnt. Her 6lue eye was riever lit up by the levity os the mind beneath. There was a melancho1y charm about it which did not seem to orise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a foul consciovs of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, whlch strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract—il was sedalo and pensjve. Wben alone, her face was never brightenod by the smile of joy; but whon her brather breatbed to her his asfectlon, and would iri ber presence forget those griefs she know destroyed his rest, who w0uld bave exchclrigod her smile for that of lhe voluptuary? It seemed as if those oyes,—lhat face were then playing in the lightof their ownnative sphere. She was yet only eighleen, and had n0t been pres-\nented to the world, it having been thovght by her gvardlans more fit that her presentation should bc delayed until her brolher'ſ return from lhe co ntinent, when he might be ber pralector. It was naw, therefore, resolved that the riext drawing-room, whjch was fast clpproaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would ralhcr bave remained ln the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowcred him. He eould not fcel intorost about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when hls mind had been so torn by the events hc had witnessed; but be determined lo sacrisice his own comfort to tbe protection of his flster. They soon arriued in town, and pro-\npared for the ncxt day, which had boen announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawjng-r0om had riot been held for a long tlme, and all who wero anxiaus to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened th ither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he waf standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that tho first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wos in that very place—he felt himself suddonly seized by the arm, and a voice he recogn ized too well, sounded iri hls ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast hiin, wheri he perceived, at a little distonce, tbe same flgure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his firsl ontry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear lheir wei ght, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw bimself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried ſteps, and fixed his harids up0n his head, as is he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstclnces started up in dreadful array—thc dagger—his oath.—He roused himself, he could not bel ieve it possible—tbe dead rise again!—He thought his imagincltion had eonjured up lhe imagc bis mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be reol—he determinod, therefore, to go again inta society; for tbough he attempted to ask concernirig Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon hif lips, and he couId not fucceed in gairiing insormation. He went a few nights after wilh his sistcr to lhe assembly of a near relatiori. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gaue himself up to his awn devovring tbougbts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roufed himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrovnded by severa1, apparently in earnest conversalion; he attempted to pass and get near her, whon one, whom he requested to move, turned round, arid revealed to him thoſc features he m0st abhorred. He sprang forward, seizcd bis sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the slreet: al the door he found himfelf impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while be was engaged in passing them, he again heard tbat voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—Ho did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, saon reached home.\nAu6rcy became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subiect, how much more completely was it ongrossed, now that thc certainty of tho monster'sliving again pressod upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had cavsed his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. Hisoath startled hiin;—was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst oll he held dear, and not avert itsprogress? His very sistermight havc been touchedby bim. But even if he were to break his oath, and discl0se his susplcions, who would believe him? He thougbt of employing his own hond to free the world from such a wrelch; but deoth, be remcmbered, had beon already mocked. For days he remained ln thjs state; shut vp iri his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her soke, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stilIness and folitude, he lefl hjs house, roamed fr0m street to slreet, anxious to fly that irnage which haunted hirn. His dress becclme ncglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to thc midnighl damps. He was no longer to he recognized;at first he retvrned with the everiing to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever faligve overtook him. His sister, anxious forhis s afety, employed people lo follow him; but they were s0on distanced by hiin who fIed from a pursuer swlftcr than any—from thought. His conduot, however, suddenly changed. Struck with lhe ideo that he left by his absence the whoIe of his friends, with a fiend amongst thein, of whose preserice thcy were unconscious, he determined t0 enter again into saciety, clnd watch him closely, anxlous to forewarri, in spite of his oath, all wham Lord Ruthven approached witb intimaey. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious lookswcre so striking, his i nward shudderings so visible, that his sister was al lclst obliged to beg of him to abſtain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remaristrclnce provod uriavailing, the gvardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearlng tbat hls mind was becomirig alieriated, they thougbt it high time to resuine agairi that truft which had been before irnposed vpon thein by Aubrey's parentf.\nDefirous of saving hirn from the lnjuries and sufferings he had d aily encountered in his wanderings, andos preventing him from exposing to tbe gerieral eye those marks of what they oonsidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in thc bouse, and take ooristant care of him. He hardly appeared to riotlce it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incohcrence became at last so great, that be was confiried to his chambor. Tbere he would oflen lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had became emociated, hls eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the anly sign os affoction and recol1ection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of hif sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizirig her hands, with looks tbat scverely afflicted her, he would desire her not to louch hirn. \"Oh, do nat toucbhim—is your love for me is aught, do not go near blm!\" When, however, fho inquired to whoin he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whenceriot even she could rouse him. This lastod rnany inonths: graduaIly, however, as the yeor was pasſing, hif incaherences hecame lefs frequent, and bis mirid threw osf a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardiorisobserved, thclt several ti mes in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then sinile.\nThe time had riearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the y ear, ane of his gvardians entering his room, began t0 conv erso with his physician upon the meIancholy circumstanceof Aubrey's being in s0 awful a situation, when hiſ sis ter was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of thjs mark of retuming iritellect, of whicb they feared he bad hoen deprived, they mentioned lhe name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl wham he hadmet with in sociely, Aubrey seemedpleased, and astonished them still more by his cxpressing his intentiori to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to sec bis sister. Tbey answered not, hut in a few minutes his sister was with him. He wos apparently agoin capa6le of beirig affected by the influence of her 1ovely ſmile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, slowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the seelings af affeclion. He b egan t0 speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her vpon hermarriage with a person so distinguished for rank and evory accomplishment; wheri he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; 0pening it, what was his surprise at behalding the features of the monster wha had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, ond trampled it under f0ot. Upon her asking hjm why he thus destroyed the resem6lance of hor future husband, he looked as if he djd not understarid her—then seizing her honds, and gazing on her wilh a frantic expression of countonance, he bade her swear thot she would never wed this m0nster, for he— Bvt he cauld not advance—it seeined af if lhat voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thiriking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In lhe moanlime tbe guardians and physiclan, who had heard the whole, and thovght this was but o return of his disorder, entered, and forclrig him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave hirn. He fell upon his kneos to them, he imp1ored, be bcgged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity lhcy imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and rotired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had beori refused with every one else. Wheri he heard af Aubrey's ill heclllh, he readily underftood himself to be the cause of it; 6ut when hc learned that he was dcemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this lnformation. He hastened to the hovfe of his former companiori, arid, by constant atteridarice, and the pretence af great affection for the brother and interest in hls fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had dangcrf and toils to reeount—could fpeak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy wjth any boing on the crowded eartb, save with her to whom be addressed himself;—could te1l how, since he know her, his existence,hcld begun to seemworthy of preseruation, jf it were merely that he might liſten to her soothing acoents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, thclt he gained her affectjons. The title of the elderbronoh fallirig at length to him, he obtoined an important embassy, which served as an excvse for bastening the marriage, (in spite af her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place thevery day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain.He askod for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjvring her, as she valued her own happiness, ber own honour, and the hanour os thoſe now in tbe grave, wha orice held her in their arms as their hope and tbe hope of their hause, to delay but for o few hours that marriage, on which he denaunced lhe mast heavy cvrseſ. The seruants promised they would deliver it; but giving lt to the physician, he thought lt bettcr not to harass any more the mind of Miss A ubroy by, what he considered, the ravings af a maniac. Nigbt passed ori without resl to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easilybe conccived than described, the notesof busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke vpon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the cuslody os an helpless o1d woman. Ho seized the opportunity, wlth one bound was out of the rooin, and in a momont favnd himself in the aparlinent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediotelyapprooched, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechlesf with ragc. When on tbe staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if nol my bride t0 day, your sister is dishonoured. Women aro frai1!\" So saying, he pushcd hlm t owards his attendants, wbo, roused by the old womon, had come in ſearch of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding uerit, had broken a blaod-vesseI, and he was conveyed to 6ed. Tbis waſ not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The mclrriage was solemriized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the esfusion of blood produced symploms of the near approach of death. He desired his fister'f guclrdians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be reIated composedly what tbe reader hos pcrused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Mifs Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, clnd Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of cl VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT DF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &o.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence hisguide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greoian Archipelago, on boord one 0f his Majesty's vesse1s, in the year 18l2, we put into tho harbour of Mitylene, in tbe island of that name. The beauty of this plclce, arid lhe certain supp1y of cattle and vegetahles always to be had there, induce manyBritiſh vefsels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmon; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, jts bountles amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, ot the b0ttom of the bay, and whilst tho mcn werc employed in watering, and thc purser bargaining for cattle with thc natives, the clergyinan and myself took arclmble to lbe cove called Homer's Scbool, and other pIaces, where we had been besore. On the brow af Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greekas our guido, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who lest the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me af a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I dld not ehoose t0 quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. Tbo cottageover the hill, facing the river, belongs lo him, and he has left an old mari in oharge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zecbines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not coristanlly; for he salls in his felucca very often t0 the difforent islands.\"\nThis acoount excited ourcurioſity uery much, and we lost no tiine in hastening lo the hovse where our c0untryinan had resided. We wore kjndly receivod by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on thc grovnd-floor—ari entrance hall, a drawirig-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, wjth clspacious o1oset annexed. They were all sjmply decorated: plain green-ſtained walls, marble lables on either side, a largo myrtle in the ccnlre, and a small sountajn heneath, wbich could be made to play tbrough the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small br0nze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood hals a dozen English cane chclirs, arid an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fingle painting. Tbe bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pjllow—thc common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, fllled wilh books and papers, whicb were then in a large seaman's chest in the closct: ll was open, but we did not tbink ourselues juſtified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recesf lay Voltaire's, Shakfpeare'f, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins 0f Empjres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Kl0pstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's n0vels; Schi1ler's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italjan edition, printed at Parina in 1810; ſeveral small pamphlets from lhe Greek press at Constantjnople, mucb tom, but no English book of any descriplion. Most os these books were filled wilh marginol notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. Tbe Mefsiah was literally scribbled all ouer, and marked with slips of paper, on which alsowere remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening bcfore he sailed, and sorgot lo place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his relurn; for he is so parlicular, that were I to move one thlng without orders, be would frown upon mo for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did hjin a ſervice; clnd I have the produce of this sarm for the trouble of laking care of it, except twenty zechjnes whioh I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the waod, and wh0m the lord brought here from Adrionople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanee of the house externolly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the flvted marble pilIars with black plinths and fret-work corniccs, (as it is now customary in Grecian architectvre,) were considerably higher than the roof. The raof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath ari awning of strong coarse linen. Most 0f the hovse-tops are tbus furnishcd, as upan them thcGreeks pass their evenings in smokjng,drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, ond enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered tho houso, asmall streamlet glided away, grapef, oranges and limes wero clustering together on its borders, and under the shade 0ftwo lorgc myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on whioh we were told, tho lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from tbis seat was whclt may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cavered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek tempIo appeared in majestic decay. A small stroam issuirig from the ruins descendcd in broken casc-\nades, until it was lost in lhe woods near thc mountain's 6aſe. The sea smoolh as glass, and an horlzon unshodowed by a single cloud, terminates the uiew in front; and a little an the left, thr0vgh a vista of loftychesnut and palm-trees, sevcralsmall islarids were distinctly observed, ftudding the light blue wave wlth spots os emerald grecn. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquirios wero fruitless as to the name of tbc person who hcld resided in this romantic soljtude: none knew his name but Domi nick, hjs banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our corid uetor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And carinot yov tell, old frjend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We bad not time to vifit tbe Armenian, 6uton our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eighl young girls whcn hc was last upon the island, and everi danced with them at tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borses lo others, and cotton and silk to the girls wha live by weaving these orticles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherrnan who hod lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Grcek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he clppeclrcd to us, fram all we collected, lo have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Dne circvmstance we learnt, which our old frlend at the coltage thougbt proper n0t to disclose. Hehad a most beautifvl daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shorc, and he had hought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSucb was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle os Mitylene; our imagjnations all on the rack, gueſsing who this rambler in Greeoe could be. He hadmoney it wcls evident: he had philanthropy os disposition, and all those eccentricities which rnark peculiclr genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, o pupil of WYATT'S, wbo had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"Tbe iridividval,\" said he, \"a6out whom yau are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on tbe island of Tenedos, and I also visited bim at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some yearſ from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized tho reclufe of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regrot not hoving been more eurious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this stateinent, belioving it not quite uninleresting, and in justice to his lordſhip's good name, whicb has been grossly slandcred. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with hvman nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be p1ainly gathored from these little anecdotes. All the siner feelingsaf the heart, so elegantly depictcd in hls lordship's poems, seem to have thejr seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympalhy, and charity appear to guide all his actionf: arid his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him aſ a bejng on whose heart Religion hatb set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"trclits\" witbout feeling proud of him as a eountryman. With respect to hjf loves or pleasvres, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reportf are ever to be roccived with oaution, particularly when directed against man's m0rcll integrily; and he who dares justify himself before lhat awful trihunal whore all must appear, alone may censure the orrars of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's charocter is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart ond self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreot.",
    "clean": "IT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did nat, however, extend itself to lhe Greeks until after the establisbment of Christiariity; and it has only assumed its preſent form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at whieh time, the ldea becoming prevalent, that a Latiri body could nol c0rrupt if buried in their territory, it graduaIly increased, and farmcd the subject of many wonderful storjes, stjll extclnt, of tho dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the Wcſt jt spread, wlth some sllght variation, alI over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nighlly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedilydied of consvmptianf; whilst lhese human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to ſuch a state of repletion, as to cause tho blaod to slow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from lhc very pores of their skins.\nIn the London JournaI, of Marcb, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accounl of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred clt Madreyga, iri Hungary. It appears, that up0n an cxamination of the commander-in-chlef and mogistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, abaut five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arriold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassavia, on tho frontiers of the Turkish Sorvia, he had boen tormented by a vompyre, but had found a way lo rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's gravo, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becorning a vainpyre himsolf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, rnany persons complairied of having been tormented by bim, and a deposition was made, that four persons hcld been deprived of life by his ottacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, taok up the body, and found it (os is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely sree srom corrupti0n, and emitting at the moutb, nose, clnd ears, pure and f1orid 6lood. Proof having been thus 0btained, they resorted to the aceustomed remedy. A stake was driveri cntirely thr0ugh the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been olive. This done, they cvt off his head, burned his body, and lhrew the ashes into hiſ grove. The same meaſures were adopted wjth lhe corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should,in their turn, become agents vpon otherswho survived them.\nThe universal belief js, thclt a person ſucked by a uampyre becoines a vainpyrc himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChlef bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, beccluse it seerns better adapled to illustrate the subject of lhe preserit observcltions than any other instance which cauld be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceasedis not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal uisitationf solely to lhose beings he loued most while upon earth—lhofe to wham he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A suppofition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre ſent, Thy corse ſhall frorn its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natjvo place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy davghter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathc the banquet which perforce Must feed thy liuid living corse, Thy victjms, ere they yot expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursirig thco, tbou cursing them, Thy flowers are w ithered on the stem. But one thclt for thy crime muft fall, The yaungest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee wilh a father's name— Thal word shall wrap thy heart in f1ame! Yel thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—hcr eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must ulew Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of ber yellow hair, Of which, in life a lockwhen shorn Affection's fondesl pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnclshing tooth, clnd haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also intraduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, wha is represerited as hauing returned from the grave for the purpofe of tormenting himshe bestloved whilst in exist-\nence. But tbis cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her 1ife, she being pourtrayod througbout tho whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veracious Taurnefort gives a long account in his travels of several astoriishing cases of vamp yrism, to which he pretends to haue been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subje ct, besides a variely of onecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrativo of its effects, hos put forth some leamed dissertatioris, tending to prove it to be a classicaI, as well as borbarian err0r.\nMany curiouf and iriteresting notices on this singularlyhorriblc superstition might be added; though the present may suffiee for the Iimils of a note, neoessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be concludod by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are soveral others synonymous with lt, made uſe of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brouco1oka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened lhat in tbe inidst of the dissi-\npations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularitieſ, than his rank. He gazed upori the mirth clround him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attrclcted his attentiori, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessncfs reigned. Thosc who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arase: some altributed it to thedead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward w0rkingſ of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a loaden ray that weighed upon the fkin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every houſe; all wished to see him, and those who bad bcen accustomed to violenl excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleosed at having something in their presence capable of engaging their altention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warinertint, eilher from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emoti0n os passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of lhe female hunters after n0taricty attempted to win his attentions, and gairi, at least, some marks of what tbey might term affectlon: Lady Mercer, who had beeri the mockery of every monster shewri in drawing-rooms since her marriage, tbrew herself in bis way, and did all but put on the dress of a mouritebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it scemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudenee was baffled, and she left the field. But though lhe c0mmon adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex wcls indifferent to him: yet fuch was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife ond innocent daughter, that few knowhe ever addrcssed himself to females. He had, however, the repulation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even ouercame the dread of his singular character, or that they weremoved by his apparerit hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who sorm tho boast af their sex from their domeſtic virtues, as among those who sully it by lheir vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: be was an 0rphan 1eft wilh an anly sister in the possession os great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in chi1dhood. Lefl cllso to himsclf by guardians, who thought it thelr duly meroly to take caro of his fortune, while they relinquisbed the more jinportant charge of bis mlrid to the carc of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feoling of horiour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprcntices. He believed al1 to sympclthise with virtue, and thovght that vice was lhrown in by Providence mere1y for tbe pieturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thovght that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variouf coloured patches. He thought, in flrie, that the drearns of poets were lhe realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into thc gay cireles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languisbing or romping favourites: the daugbters at the same tjme, by their brigbtening counlenances when he approached, and by their sparkling oyes, when he operied his lips, soon led him into folse notions of his talents clnd hiſ merit. Attacbed cls he was to the romance of his salilary hours, he was start1ed at finding, that, exeept in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from warit of snuffing, there was n0 foundotion iri real life for clny of that congeries of pleasing pietures and descriptions c0ntained in those volvmes, from whioh he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish hls dreams, when tbe extraordinary being we have above described, orossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibllity of formirig an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, wh0 gclve few other signs of his observation of external objects, thari the taclt asserit to their existe nee, implied by tbe avoidance of their c0nlact: allowing his imagination to picture every thirig lhat flattered its propensity t0 extravagant ideas, he soon formcd this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the affspring of his fancy, ratber thari the person beforo him. Hc beoame aequainted with him, paid him clttentions, and so far cldvclnced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven'ſ affairs were embarrassed, and soon sound, from the notes of pr cparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gainirig some inforination respecting this singular character, who, till now,had on1y whetted his cvriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, whjch for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon cln equality wjth the aged, and not allowing thern to appeor as if fallen srom the skies, wheneuer ſcandalous intrigues are menti oned as the subjects of pleasantry or af praise, according to the degree of skjIl shewn in carrying them on. They oonsented: and Aubrey immediatoly mentioning his intentions to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to reccive from him a proposal to join him. FIattered by ſuch a mark of esteem from him, who, apparenl1y, had nothing in coinmori with other men, he gladly accepted it, and ln a fow days they hcld passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studylng Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found, that, tbough many more os his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to hiſ conduct. His oompanion was profvsc in his liberalily;—the idlo, the vagabond, and the beggar, received srom his hand more tban cnough to reljeve thelr immedlate wants. But Aubrcy could not avoid remarking, lhal it was not upon the vlrtuous, reduced to indigence by the misforlunes attendant euen upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneerſ; but when the profligate came to ask something, not lo relieue his wants,but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he wos sent away with rich charity. This was, however, altributed by him to lhe greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There wos orie cireumstance about the charity of hiſ Lordship, which was slill more impressed upon his mind: al1 those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were aIl either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brusfels and other towns through which tbey passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparcnt eagerness with which hls companion sought for the contres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he bctted, arid always gainbled wilh succesf, except where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and lhen he lostcven more than he gained; but it was always witb the samo vnchangingface, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, sa when he encountered thc rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his vory wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of inind was laid aside, and his eyes sparklcd with more fire than tbat of the cat whllst dclllying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youtb, torn from lhe oircle he adorned, cursjng, in the solitude of a dungeori, the fate tbat had drawn him within the reach of this fiond; whilst rnany a fathor sal frantjc, arnidst the speoking looks of mute hurigry children, without a single farthing 0fhis late immense wealth, wherewith lo buy even sufficiont to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from lhe gambling tablc; but immedialely lost, to the ruirier of rnclny, the last gilder he had just snatched from tho convulsive grasp of lhe innocenl: this might but be the resvlt of a certaln degree of knowledge, whieh was not, however, cclpable of combating the cunning of the more experien ced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to hif friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasuro which proved the ruin of al1, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, and amidst lhe various wild and rich scenes of nature, was alwclys the samc: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosily, he obtained rio greater gratiflcation from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break thot mystery, which ta his excllted imaginatiori began to assurne tbe appeararice of somelhing supernatural.\nThey s0on arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of bif companion; he left him in daily atlendance upon the morning circle of ari Italian countess, whilst he went in search os lhe memorials of another almost desertcd city. Whllst be was thus engaged, letters arrivod from England, which he opened witb eager impatience; the firsl was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the othors were from his guardians, the latter astonlshed hjm; is it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power reslderit in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leauing his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for thot the possession of irresistible powers of seductjon, rendered biſ licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, lhat his conternpt for the adultresſ had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, lo enbance his gratification, that bis victim, tho partnor of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pinnacle of unsullied vlrtuc, down to the lowest abyss of irifamy and degradation: in fine, tbat all thoso females whom hc had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, bad, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole def ormity of their vices to lhe pub1ic gaze.\nAubrcy determined uporileaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point ori which to rost the eye. He resoIvod to invent some plavsible pretcxt for aband0ning him altogotber, purposlng, in the mean while, to watch bim more closely, and to let no slighl oircumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soori perceivod,that his Lordship was erideavouring to work upon the inexperience of the doughter of tbe Iady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is soldom thclt an unmorried female is mel with in society; he waf theresore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye sollowed him in oll his windirigs, and soori discovercd that an assigriation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the rvin of an inn0cent, thougb thoughtleſs gjrl. Losing no lime, he entered the apclrtment of Lord Ruthven, and ahruptly asked him his intentions wlth respecl to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his belng about lo meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answercd, lhat his intentions were such as he svpposed clll w0vld havc upon such on occasiori; and upon being pressed whether he lritended t0 marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, irnmediately writing a riote, to say, that from that moment he must decline aceompanying his Lordship in the reinainder of lhejr proposedtour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and callirig upon the mother of the lady, informed her of aIl ho kncw, nol only wllh regard to her daughter, 6utalso concerning tbe charaeler of his L0rdshjp. The assignation was prevented. Lord Rutbuen next day merely sent hif servclnt to notify his complete assent to a separcltian; bvt did not hint any suspicion of his plans havlng heen foiled by Au6rey'f interposllion.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towardf Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, s0on found himself at Athens. Hc then fixed his residenee in thc houſe of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the fclded records os ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling lhe deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering ſojl or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beclutiful and delicate, that she m ight have formed the mode1 for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of thc faithful in Mahoinet'f paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for ariy 0ne to think ſhe could belong to those wbo had no souls. As she danced up0n the plain, or trjpped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would hove exchanged her eyc, apparontly the eye os animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suiled but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ionthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unc0nſcjous girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floatlng as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gazo of him, who fargot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in thecantemplation of hor sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses folling, as sho flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicotely brilliant and swiftly fading huef, it might well excuse lbe forgetfulnefs of the antiquar y, wbo let escape froin his mirid the very object he had befare tho-\nught of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pousariias. But why attempt lo describe charms whichall feel, butnone can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawlng-roorns and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished lo preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watoh the magic effectſ of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing iri her infancy; and then, turning t0 svbjects that bad evidently made a greater irnpression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural talef of her riurse. Hcr earnestness and apparent belicf of what she narrated, excitod the inlereft cven of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had possed years amidst his friends, and doarest tief, fo rced cvery year, by feedingupon thc life os a louely fernale to prolong his oxistence sor thc ensving months, bis blood would run cold, whilst he atteinpted to lclugh ber out ofsuch jdle and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe cited to him the naines of old men, who had at last detectcd one living amang lhemselves, aster several os their near relatiues and children had beeri found marked with the stamp of tho fiend's appetite; and when she sound him so inoredulous, she begged os him to believe her, for it hadbeen, remarked, that those who haddared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbrcaking, to oonfess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthveri; he, howeve r, slill persiſted in persuading her, that there could be no truth iri her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidcnces which had all tended to excitc a belief in the supernaturol power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himfelf more and more to Ianthe; hcr innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won hiſ heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari uneducated Greek girl, slill be sound himseIf more andmore attached to the aIm0st falry formbefore him. He wouId tear himsels at times from her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian research, he would depart, determined nat to retum until his object wcls attairiod; but he always found it impossible to fix his atte-\nnt ion vpon the ruins around him, whilsl in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rlghtful p0ssessor of his thougbts. Ianthe waf unconsci0us of his love, and was ever the sclme frank infantile being he had first known. She cl1ways seemed to part from hirn with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one witb whom she could visit her favourite haunts, wbilst hcr guardian was occupied in skotching or unc0vering some fragment which had yet esoaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with seueral present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon afler, Aubrey determined to proceed vpon one of hiſ excursions, which was to detain him for a few hovrs; wheri they heard the name of the placc, they all at once hegged of him not to rcturn at night, as he must necessarily pass through o wood, wbere no Groek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any considera tion. They described it as the resort of tho vampyres ln their nocturnal orgjes, and denounced the moft heauy evils as impending upon him wha dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw tbem ſhvdder at his darlng thus to mock o superior, infernal power, the very naine of whichapparently made thcir blood sreeze, he was silent.\nNext inorning Aubrey set ofs upon his excursion unattendcd; he wcls surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had infpired them withsuch terrar. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the ſide of his horse, and earnestly begged af him to return, ere night allowed the powcr of these belngs to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-lighl would so0n end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer cliinotes, so rapidly gather into atremendous maſs, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counlry.—He at last, however, mounted his h0rse, determined to make up by speed for hif delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southernclimatos, is almost unkn0wn; immediately the svn sets, night begins: and ere he had adva-\nnced far, the power of lhe storm was above—its echoing thundershad scarcely an interval of rest—ils thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopyirig soliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse toak frjght, and he wos carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fotigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, thclt he was in lhe neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself vp from the masscs of dead leavos and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at lcast trusting to obtain sheIter from the pelting of the storm. As he approachod, the thunders, for a mornent silent, a1lowed him to hear tho dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stisled, exultant mockery of a laugb, continued in one almost unbro keri sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which agairi rolIed over his head, he, with o sudden eff-\nort, sorced operi the door of the hul. He faund himself in utler darkness: the sourid, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceiued; for, thougb he cal1ed, sti1l the s0unds coritinued, and no notice was taken as him. He found hiinself in coritact with sorne one,whom he immediately seized; when o uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to whlch a loud laugb succeeded; and he felt himsclf grappled by one whose stren gth seemed superhuman: determined lo sell his life as dearly af he could, he struggled; but it was invain: he was lifted from his seet arid hurled with enorm0us force against thc ground:—his cnemy threwhimself upon him, and kneeling upon his breaft, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetraling through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly r0se, and, leaving hiſ prey, rufbed through the door, and in cl moment the crasbing os tbe branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapablc of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; tbe light of lheir torches fell vpon the mud walls, and the tbalch loaded on every indiuidual straw wlth heavy flakes of soot. At the defire of Aubrey lhey searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was agaln left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches orice more bvrſt upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress hrought in a lifelesf corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visiori arising from hls disturbed imaglnation; but he again saw lhe sarne form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no calour upon hcr cheek, not even vpon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face lhat seemed alinost as attaehing as the life that once dwelt lhero:—up0n her neck and breast was blood, and up0n her throat were the marks of teeth having op oned the vein:—to this lhe men pointed, cryjng, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was qulckly formed, and Aubrey was laid by lhe side of hcr who had lately been to hjm the object os so many bright and fajry vjsions, now faIlen with the fIower 0f life thol had died within her. He knew not what bis thoughts were—his rnind was benumbed and seemed to ſhun reflection, and take refuge in vacclncy—he held olinost unconsciously in his hand a naked daggor of a particulclr coristruction, which had been fou nd in tho hut. They were soon met by different parties who bad been engaged lri tbe search of her wh0m a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To descrlbe their grief would be impossible; hut when they ascertained the cause of thelr child's death, they looked at Aubrey, andpointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; 6oth died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was sejzed with a most violent sever, arid wcls often delirlous; in these iriteruals he w0uld call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combjnation he seemed lo beg of his foriner coinpanion to spclre the being he loved. At ather times he would imprecate maledictions upan his bead, and curse him as her dostroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this tjme lo arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state os Aubrey, iminediately placed himself in the same house, and becclme his oonstant attendant. When the latter recovered from bis dcliriuin, he was horrified and ftartled at the sight of him whose imclge he had now combined wilh that of aVornpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying olmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separalion, and still more by the attention, anxiety, orid care whieh he showed, soon reeonciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite ehanged; he no longer appeared thclt apathetjc bcing who hcld so astonished Aubrey; hut as soon as his convalefoence began to be rapid, be again gradually retired into the same state os mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprjsed ta meet his ga2e fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultatiori playing upon his lipſ: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage af the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apporeritly engaged in watching the tidelesf waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking lhe progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless svn;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the oycs of all.\nAubrey's mind, by tbis shock, was much weakened, and that elasticily of spirit which had oncc so distinguished him now seemed to havo fled forever. He was now as mvcb a lover of ſolitude and silence as Lord Rulhven; but much as he wished sor solilude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he saught it amidst tho ruins he had formerly frequentod, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in lhe wo0ds, her light step would appcar wandering amidst the undcrwood, in quest os the modest violet; lhon suddenly turning rovnd, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale faco and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every seature of which crcaled such bitter assooialions iri his mind. He prop0sed to Lord Ruthven, to whorn he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his lllness, that they should visit tbose parts of Greece neither had yet soen. They travelled in every direction, arid sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: bul though they thuſ hast-\nened from place to placc, yet they seemed riol to hoed what they gazed upon. They heard much os robbers, but they graduaIly began to sljght these reports, which they imagined were only the inuention os indiuiduals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from preterided dclngers. In consequcnce of thus negleoling the advice of the inhclbitants, on one occasion they trauelled with only a few guards, mare to scrve as guides than as a defen ce. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at tbe bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock broughl down from thc neighbouring prccipices, they had reason to reperit their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling 0f bullets close to their heads, and 6y lhe echoed report of several guns. In an irislant their guards had left them, clnd, placing themselves hehirid rocks, bad begun to fire in lhe direction wherice tbe report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, re tired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile:bul ashamed of belng thus detained 6y a foe, who with insulting shouts bade tbem advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of tbe ro6bersshould climb above and take them in the rear, theydetermined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to bis assjstance; and, no longer heeding lhe contest or his own peril, was soon svrprised by seeing the rob6ers' faces around him—hls guards hauing, upon Lard Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surreridored.\nBy promifes of great reward, Aubrey soon indueed them to corivey his wounded frierid to a rieighbouring cabin; and hauing agreed upon a ransom, he was no more djsturbed by tbeir presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for wbich he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strenglh rapldly decreased; in two days mortificationensued, arid death seeined advancirig with hasty stops. His conduct and appeararicc had not changed; he seemed as unconfcious of pain cls he had been of the objecls obouthim: but towords the close of the last evening, his mind became appareritly unoasy, and his eye often fixed uponAubrey, who was induoed to ofser his assistclnco with mare than usual earnestness—\"Assist mc! you may ſave me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed lhe death os my existencc as litlle as that of the passing day; but yau may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any lhing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—bvt if you wovld conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death wcro unknowri for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violerice, \"Swcarby all your sovl reueres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death lo any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockels: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; hc sunk laughlng upon his pi1low, and breathod no mare.\nAubrey relired lo rest, but did riot sleep; the many circumstancos attendirig his acquaint-\nance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he romembered his oath a cald shivering caine over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter tho hovel in which he had left the corpſe, when cl robber met him, and informed him that it was no langer there, having beeri conveyed by himself and comradcs, upon his retiring, to the pinnaole os a nelghbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the sirst cold ray of thc moon that rose afler his dcath. Aubrey astonished, and taking soveral of the men, determined ta go and bury it upori the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the suinmit he fouridno trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the rob6ers swore they poirited out the identical rock on which lbey had laid the body. For o tlme his mind was 6ewildered in conjecturos, butbe at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in wbich all apparently conspirod to heighten that superstitious melancholy tbal had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and foon arrived at Smyrncl. While wailing for a vessel to convey him to Otrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging thoſe effects he had with him belonging lo Lord Rvthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing sevoral weapons of offence, more or less adaptod to ensure the death of the viclim. T here were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at findirig a sheath appclrently ornamented in the fame style aſ the dclgger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—haslening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, arid bis horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fittcd, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in bis hand. His eycs seemed to need no further certainty—thcy seeined gazing to be bovnd to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the samo varyirig tints upon tho haft and sheath were alike in sp lendour on both, and lofl no room f0r doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe lest Smyrna, and on bis way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady hc had ottempted lo snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not becn heard of since the doparture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken undcr so mariy repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urgirig the speed os thc postilions, as if he were going to sove thc life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a hreezc, which seemed obedient to his wi1l, foon wafted bim to the English shores; ond he hastened to the monsion of his fathers, and there,for a momcnt, appeared to lose, iri the embraces and careſses of his sister, all memory of the past. If sho bef0re, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his affection, now thal the woman began t0appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey hod not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was nonc of that light 6rilliancy whi ch only exists in the beated atmasphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mlnd beneath. There was a melclncholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, bvt from some feeling within, that appearedto indicate a soul conscious os a brighterrealin. Her step was riot that light footing, wbich ſlrays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightcried by the smile of joy; but when herbrother breathed to her his affection, and would in her preſence sorget those griefs she knew destroycd his rost, who would have exchanged her smjle for that of the voluptuary? It seemcd as if those eyes,—thclt face were then pIaying in the llght of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and bad not boen presented to the world, it having been thougbt by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when hc might bo her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch 0f her on try into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the rnansi0n of his fathers, and fed upon lhe me1anchaly which overpowered him. He could not feel jnterest about the frivolities of fashionoble strarigers, when hiſ mind had been so torn by the evontshe had wilnesfed; but ho determined to sacriflce his own c0mfort to the proteclion of hiſ sister. They soon arrived in towri, and prepared for the next doy, which had hecn announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowdwas excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened tbitber. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilc he was standing in a corner by himfels, heedless of all ar0und him, erigclged in the reinembrance that the first time be had seen Lord Ruthuen was in thclt very place—he felt hlmself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voiee he recognized toa well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He hod hardly courage to turn, fearful of seejng a spectre that would hlast him, when he perceived,at a litt1e distancc, the same figure which had attractedhis notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his llmbs a1most refusing to bear thoir weight, be was obliged lo take the arm 0f a frlend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, clnd was driven home. Ho pacod the rooin with hvrriod steps, and fixed his hands upon his heod, as if he were afraid his thoughts were 6ursting from his brain. Lord Rvthveri again before him—circumstarices sta-\nrtcd up in dreadful array—the dogger—his oath.—He roused himself, ho could not bclieve it possible—the dead riso again!—He thought his imagjnation had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible lhat it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he atteinpted to ask concerning Lord Ruthuen, the name hung upon his lips, and he could nat succeed in gaining jnformation. He went afew nights after with his sister to the assemhly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired jnto a recess, and t here gave himself up to his own devouring lhoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he r0used himself, clrid entering another room, fourid his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to him lhose features be most abhorred. He sprong forward,seized his sister's arm, and, with hurricd step, forced her towords the slreet: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lordſ; and while he was erigaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did riot dare to turn, but, hurrying hls sister, s0on reached home.\nAubrey becaine almost dlstractod. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much m0re completely was it engrossed, now that lhe certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon hiſ thovghts. His sisler's attentians were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to cxplain to her what had oaused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more be tbought, the more he wasbewildered. His oath startled him;—was he then to allow this mon ster toroarn, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidſt all he held dear, andnot avert its progress? His very sifter might have been touched by him. But even if he were lo break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who wovld believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such o wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. F0r days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes strcoming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nalure. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solilude, hc left his house, roamcd froin street to street, anxious t0 fly that image whi ch haunted him. Hjs dress became neglected, arid be wandered, os often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer t0 be recognized; at first he retumed wilh lhe evening to tbe house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue 0vertook him. His sister, anxious for his sclfety, employed people to folIow him; but they were soon distanced by him wbo fled from a pvrsuer swifter than any—srom thaught. His conduct, however, sudderily changed. Struck with the idca that he lest by his obsence the whole of hif friends, with a fiend am0ngst them, of wboseprosence they were unconscious, he determined to entcr again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his o ath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard arid suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that hjs sister was at last obliged to beg of hlm to abstain from seeking, for her sake, cl society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavcliling, the gvardians th ougbt pro per t0 interpose, and, fearing lhat his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been besore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDeſirous os saving him from the lnjuries and ſufferingſ he had daily encovntered in his wanderin gs, and of prevonting him from exposing to the genercll eye lhose marks of what they considored folly, they engaged a physician to refide in the house, and toke coriſtant eare of him. He hardly appcared to notice il, fo comp1etely was hif mind a6sorbed hy one lerrible subjcct. His incoherence becamo ot last so great, that he was confiried to his cham6er. Thero he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes hod atlairied clglassy lustre;—tbe only signof affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would fometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with lo0ks that sevorely aff1jcted hor, he would desire hor nat to louch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your lovefor me js aught, do not go near him!\" When, bowever, sbe inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! trve!\" and again he sank inta a state, wbence not even sbe could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passlng, his incoherences became loss frequent, and his mind threw osf a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite riumber, arid then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of tbe year, one of his guardians entering hiſ room, 6egan to converse with his physician upon the melanchoIy circumſtance of Avhrey's being in ſo awful a situation, when hif sister was going next day to be marrled. Instantly Aubrey's attentionwas attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelIect, af whjch they feared he had been depriued, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in soolety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonlshed them still more by hif expressing his intentian lo be present ot the nuptials, and desiririg to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutcs his fister was wjth him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her louely smile; for he pressed her to his 6reast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more a1ive to the feclings of affeetion. He began to speak with all bis wonted warmth, and to congralulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upori her breast; 0pening it, wbat was his surprise at beholding tbe features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxyſm of rage, and trampled it vnder foot. Upon her asking him why he lhus destroyed the resemblarice of hcr futurehvsband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantjc expreſsion of countenance, he bade her swear that ſhe would never wed this rnonster, for he— But he could n0t advance—it seomed as if that vojce again bade him remeinber his oath—he turried suddenly raun d, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him bvt saw no one. In the meantime thc guardians and physiciari, who hadheard the wholc, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing bim from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave hiin. He fell upon his knces to them, he implored, he begged of them to deloy but for onc day. They, attrihuting this to the insanity they imagined had taken passeſsion of his mind, endeavoured to pacjfy him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had colled the morning after the drclwing-room, and had 6een refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily uriderstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concoaIed from those among whoin he had galnod this inforination. He hclsteried to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interestin his sate, he gradually won tbe ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had dclngers and toi1s to recount—could fpeak af himself as of an indiuidua1 having rio sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her lo wh0m he addressed hiinself;—could lell how, sjnce he knew her, his existericc, had begun to feem warthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her sootbing accents;—in fine, he knew so well haw to use the serpent's art, or such was the wi1l of fate,that ho gained her affections. The title of the e1der branch fcllling at length lo him, he obtained an important cmbassy, which served as an excvse for hastening the marriage, (in ſpite of hcr brother's deranged stote,) which was to take pl ace the very day before hiſ departure for thecontinent.\nAubrey, when he waf left by the physician arid his guardians, attompted to bribe the servants, hut in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his sjsler, conjuring her, as she ualved her own happincss, her own honour, and the honour of tbose now in the grave, who once held her in tbeir armſ as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which hedenounced the most heavy curses. The servantſ promised they would deliver it; bulgiving it lo the physjcian, he thought it bettcr not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Nigbt passed on without rest tothe busy inmates of thc houfe; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more eclsi1y bc conceived than desorjbed, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew alrnost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last over came their vjgilance, they gradvally stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He scized the opportunily, with orie bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himsels in the apartment where all were nearly assem6led. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by farce, hurriedhim from tbe room, spe-\nechlesf with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ea r—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride ta day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushedhim towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woma n, had come in search of hjm. Aubrey oould no longcr support himself; his rage not finding vent, bad broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. Thlf was not inentioned to his si ster, who was not preſent whcn he ontered, as tho physician was afraid of agilating ber. Tbe marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom Ieft London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sisler's guardjans mightbe ca1led, and when the midnight hour had ftruck, he re1ated composodly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when lhey arrjved, it was toa late. Lord Ruthven had dlsappoared, and Aubrey's sisler had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER,CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was clll before him, wbere to choofehjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board ono of his Majesty'f vessels, in the year 1812, we put inlo the barbour of Mitylene, in the iſland of that naine. The beauty of this placo, and the certairi supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels tovisit it—both men of war and merchonlmcn; and th0ugb it lies rather out of the lrack for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounlies amply repay sor the deviation of a v0yage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the pvrser bargaining for cattle with the natiues, lhe clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Sch0ol, and other pIacef, where we had been before. On lhe brow of Mount Ida (a smalI monticule so named) we met wjth and engaged a young Greek as our guide, wh0 told us be had come from Scia with an English lord, who left the jsland four dclys preuious to our arrival iri hls se1-\nueccl. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would bave taken me with him; but I did not ehoose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to got married. He wcls an odd, but a very good mon. The cottage over the hill, facing the riuer, belongs to him, and he has left ari old man in chorge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (obo ut L250 English currency,) and has rcsided there aboul fourteen months, though not conftantIy; for he sails in his felucca very often to lhe different islands.\"\nThis account oxcited our curiosity uery much, ond we lost no time in hostenirig to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old rnan, who conducted us ouer the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an enlrance hall, a drowing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet anriexed. They were clll simpIy decorated: ploin green-stained waI1s, marbIe tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play throvgh the bronebes by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small br0nze Venvſ in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furnitvro. In the ball stood half a dozen English cane chairs,and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had rnerely a large mattress spread on lbe floor, with two stvffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the cornmon bed throughout Greece.In the sitting-room we observed cl marble rccess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in cl large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not lhink oursolves justlfled in oxamining lhe contents. On tbe tablet os the recess lay Voltajre's, Shokspeare's, Boileau's, and Rovsseau's workf complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schillor's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlels from the Greek press at Canstantinople, rnuch torn, but no English book 0f any description. Most of these books were filled with margirial notes, written with a pencil, in Italian clnd Latin. The Messiah was literaIly scribbled all over, and marked with sllps af paper, on wbich also were remarks.\nThe old mcln said: \"The lord had been reading these books the everiing befare he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" ſaid he, \"there they must lle until his returri; sor he is sa parliculclr, that were I to move ane thing withoutordors, he would frownvpon me for a week t0gether; he is othorways very good. I once djd him a fervice; and I haue the praduce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resldes in a sinall cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianop1e; I don'l know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance af tho house external1y was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty paces lang and fourteeri brocld, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work corniccs, (as jt is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were corisiderably higher than the roos. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tvrkey carpet, beneath an awnlng of st rong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus fvrnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smokirig, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying tho cvenirig breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clusteririg together on itf borders, and under lhe shadc of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with on ornamental w ooden back was placed, on which we werc told, the lord passed many of his cvenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and tcllking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view froin lhis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye vlew.\" A line of rich vineyardsled lhe eye to Mount Calcla, covered with oljve and myrtle trees iri b1oom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek lemple appeared in majestic decay. A smclll ftream issuirig from the ruins descended in braken cascades, until it waslost in the woodf near the mountain's base. Tbe sea smootb as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single clovd, terminates the view in front; arid a little on the left, througha vista of lofty chosnut and palrn-trees, several sinall islands were distinctly obſerved, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I se1dorn enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name oftbe person who had resided in this romontic solilude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gonc to Candia. \"Tbe Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"cou1dtell, but I am sure he willnot,\"—\"And cannol you tell, old friend?\" ſaid I—\"If I can,\" ſaid he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on ovr return to the town we lcarnt soveral particulars os the isolated l ord. He had portioned e ight young girls when he was last upon the is1and, and even danced with them at lhe nuptial feast. He gave a oow to 0ne man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who liue by weauing these articIes. He also boughl a new boat for a fisherman wha had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the poor childron. In short, be appeared to us, from a1l we collected, to have been a very eccentric and bonevolent character. Orie circurnftance we learnt,which our old friend at the cottage thought proper nol to disclose. He had a most beautiful davghter, with whom theIord was often seen walking ori the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the vse os it.\nSuch was the information with which we deported from the peaceful isIe of Mitylene; our imogin-\nations all on the rack, guessjngwho lhis rambler in Greecc could be. Ho had money it was euldent:he had philanthropy of dispofition, and all thoſe eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived clt Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FDSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels an thc islond of Tenedos, and I also viſited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years sram home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recogni2ed the recluse of Calcla in every poge. Deeply did we regret not having been more curiovs in our researcheſ at tbo cattage, bvt we consoled ourselves witb the idea os returning to Mitylene on ſome future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not qvile uriinteresting, and in justice t0 his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling djsposition, averso to associating withburnan nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is direclly the reverse, as may be plainly gathcred from these Iittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elcgantly depicted in his lordship'ſ poems, seem to have tbeir seat in his hosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his eourting the repose of solitude is cln additional reason sor mark ing him as cl being on whose heart Religion hath set her sea1, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle.

    "clean": "About the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon whlch this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appcars to be common: it did not, however, extend itself ta the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which timo, the idea becoming prevalent, tbat a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradua1ly increased, and formed the subjecl of many wanderful stories, stjll extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon thc blood of the yourig and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variatjori, al1 over Hvngary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorraine, where the beljef existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedjly diod of consumptions; whilst tbese human blood-suckers fattened—and thoir veins bccame distended lo such a state of repletion, as ta cause tbe bIood to flow from all the passages af their bodies, and even froin the very pores of thejr skins.\nIn the London Joumal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accovnt ofa particular caſe of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, thatupon an examinatjon of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arno ld Paul, had been heard to say, that, cll Cassovicl, on the frontjers of the Turkish Servia, be had been tormentcd by a vampyre, but had found a woy to rid himself of the euil, by eating soine of the earth out of the vampyr-\ne's grave, and rubbing bimself with his blood. Thiſ precaution, however, did nol prevent him from becomlng a vampyrc himſelf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons coinplained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was mclde, that four porsoris hcld been deprivcd 0f life by his attacks. To prevent fvrther miſchief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagnj, took up the bady, and found it (as is supposed lo be usual jn cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirelyfree fr0m corruption, and emlttlng at the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and floridbload. Proaf having been thus obtairiod, they rosorted to tho accuslomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burnedhis body, and threw the ashes int0 his grave. The same measures wcre adopted wlthlbe c0rses of thoso persons who hod previously died from vompyrisin, lest they should, iri their turri, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal beljef is, that a porson sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrovs rodomontade is here related, bccause it seems better adapted to illvstrate the subject of the prescnt observations than any other lnstarice whjch could be adduced. In mclny partsof Greece it is oonsidered as a sort of punishment after dcath, for somo heinous crimc committed whilst in oxistence, thot tbe deceased is not only doorned to vampyrise, but eompelled to confine his infernal vifitations solely to those beings he loved most whiIe up0n earth—those t0 whom he was bound by tics of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,Thy corfe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the riative place, And suck the blood ofall thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wjfe, Atmidnight drain lhe stream of life; Yet loatbe the banqvet whioh perforce Mvst feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, ere tbey yel expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy slowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must foll, The youn gest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee witb a father 's name— That word shall wrap thy hearl in flame! Yet thou mvst ond tby task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And tbe last glassy glance must view Whicb freezcs o'er its lifcless blue; Then with unhal1owed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock wben shorn Asfection's fo ndest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thce Memorial of thineagony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashirig tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—arid witb GouIs and Afrits rave, Till theso in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey bas olso introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" thc vampyre c0rseof the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having retumed from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved wbilst in exislence. But this cannot be supposed to bave resulled fr0m the sinfulness of her life, sbe bei ng pourtrclyed throughout tho whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his lravels of several ast0nishing cases of vampyrism, to which he preterids to bave been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this fubject, besides a variety of anecdotes, arid traditionary narrcltives illustrative os its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious andinteresting notiees on this sirigularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present moy suffice for the limils of a note, necesfarily devoted to explclnation, and wbich rnoy riow bc conclvded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in rnosl general acceptation, there are severalothers synoriymous with it, madc use of in various partf of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happenod that in the mjdsl of the dissipatians attendant upon a London wiriter, there appeared al the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemari, more remarkable for hjs singularities, than bis rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he cou1d not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughler of the fair only attracted his attenlion, tbat he might by a laak qvell it, and tbrow fear into those breosts whero thoughtlcssness reigned. Those wh0 felt this sensation of owe, could not explain whence itarose: sorne attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's facc, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce thr-\nough to the inward workings ofthe heart; but fell upon the cheek wlth a lcaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities cauſed him to be invitod to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had heen accuslomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleasod at having something in their prefenceeapable os engaging tbejr attention. In fpite of the deadly bue of his faeo, wbich nevcr gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion os possjon, th0ugh its form and out1ine were beaulisv1, many of the female hunters after notoriety altempted ta win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe moc kery af every m0nsler shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when sho slood before him, though his eyes were apparently flxod upon her's, slil1 it seemed as if they wero unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled,and she left the fjeId. Bvt though the comrnon adultress oould not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparentcaution with which he spoke to the vlrtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed h imsels to semales. He had, however, the reputatiori af a winni ng torigue; and whether it was that it even overcarne the dread af hls singvlar character, or that they werc moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was as often among thoso semales who form the boast of their sex frorn thejrdomestic virtues, as ainong those who sully it by their vices.\nA bout the same tirne, there came to London a young gentlemcln of the name of Aub rey: he was an orphan left with cln only sisler iri the possession of great wealth, by parents who diod while he was yet in childhood. Lest also ta himself by guardiclns, who thought it their dvty merely to take careof his fortune, whjle they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgmerit. He had, hence, that high romantic feellng of honour arid candour, whicb daily ruins so many miIljners' apprentioes. He be1ieved all to sympathise witb virtue, and thought thal uice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque efsect of the scerie, as we see in romarices: he thought thal the misery of a cottage morely consisted jri the vesting of clothos, which were af warm, but which were better adapted lo the painter's eyc by their irregulor folds and various coloured patches. He thovghl, in fine, thal the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was haridsome, frank, and rich: for tbese reasons, upon his entoring into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded bim, striuing which should describe with least trulh their languishing or romping favourites: the daughlers at tho same time, by their brightening countenanccs when he approached, and hy thelr sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notionsof his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance os hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the taIlaw and waxcandles lhat flickered, not from the preseneo of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of ploasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensationin bis gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above descri6od, crossed him in his career.\nHc walched him; and the very impossibility of formingan idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in bimsclf, who gave few other signs of his abservation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance os their contact: allowing bis jmagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensily to extravagant ideas, he s0on formed this object lnto the hero of a romance, clnd determiried to observe the offſpring of his fancy, rather tbari the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was alwclys recagnised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation iri — Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiofity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for hjrn to perform the tour, which for many generations hos been thought necessary to onable the young lo take some rapid steps in the carecr of vice towards putting themselves upon an equcllity with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as is fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous iritrigucs are mentioried as the subjectſ of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree os skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediotely mentioning his intenlions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from bim, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly ao cepted it, and in a few days they had passed tbe oircling waters.\nHitherto, Aubroy had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's charactor, and now be fovnd, that, though many more of his aclions were exposed lo his view, the results osfered diffcrent eonclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from bis hand more than cn0ugh to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey covId nat avoid remarking, that it wos not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by lhe misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed snee rs; bul wheri the profligatecame to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wclllow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniqvity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed hy him to the greater importunity af the vicious, which generally prevails over the reliring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance obout lhe charity of his Lordship, which was still more improssed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was beſtowed, inevitably found that there was acurse upon it, for they were all eithcr led t0 the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and tbe most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns tbrough which tbey pafscd, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparerit eagerness with which his campanion sought for the centres of all fasbioriable vice; there he entered into oll the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the knownsharper was bis clntclgonist, clnd then he lost even more thclri he gained; but it was alwclys with the fame unchanging fac e, with which he gerierally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered thc rash youthful novlce, or the luckloss father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed forturie's low—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aſide, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than lhat of the cat whilſt dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left tho formerly asfluent youth, torn from the circle be adorried, curfing, in the soli tude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn bim wilhiri the reacbof this fiend; whilst mony a fatber sat frantic, amjdft the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealtb, wherewith to buy even sufficiont to satisfy their preſent craving. Yet he to0k no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, lhe last gildor he had iust snatcbed from the corivulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but bc the result of a certajn degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of combating tho ounning of tho more experienced. Aubrey ost en wished to repreſent this to his friend, and beg him to resign thclt charity and pleasuro which proved the ruin 0f all, and did not tend t0 his own profit;—bvt he dclayed it—for each day he bopod his friend would givo him some opportunity of spcaking frankly and openly to hiin; howevcr, lhis never occurred. Lord Ruthven iri his carriage, and amjdst thc uarious wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: bis eye spoke less than his lip; and lhough Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no groater gratification from lt than the conftant oxcitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exaltedimagination began to assumcthe appearclnce of samething supernatural.\nThey soon arrived cll Rome, and Aubrey fora time 1ost sight of his oompanion; he left him in daily clttendance uponthc morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of anothor almost desorted cjty. Whilst be was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatienoe; the first was from his sister, breathjng nothing but affectjon; the others were from hiſ guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had besore entered into his irnaginatjon that lhere wcls an evil pawer resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufsjcient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his imrnodiately leaving his friend, clrid vrged, that bis character was dreadfully uici0us, for that the possession of irresistjble powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to soeiety. It had been discovcred, that his contcmpt for the odultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, tbe partner of his guilt, sbould be hurled from the pinnclcle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abysſ of infamy and degradation: in sine, that all those fernales whom ho had sought, apparently on account of their uirtue, hod, sirice his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not sorupled to expose the whole deformlty of their vices to the publie gaze.\nAubrey deterrnined up0n 1eaving orie, whose oharacter had not yet shown o single brigbt point on wbich to rest the eye. He resolvcd to invent some plauſible pretext for abandoriing hjm altogcther, purposing, in the mean whjle, to watch him more closely, and to let rio slight circumstances poss by urinoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordshjp was endeauouring to work upon the iriexperience of thedaughler 0f the lcldy whose house ho chie-\nfly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female if met with in society; he wcls tberefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignationhad been appoirited, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, lhough thought1ess girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of L0rd Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him al thc fame time thclt be was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentians were such as he supposed all would have upon svch an occasion; and upon being preſsed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey rctired; and, immedialely writing a note, t0 say, that frorn that moment be must declino accornpanying his Lordship in thc remoinder of their proposed tour, he ordered his fervant to seek other apartments, and oalling upon the rnother af the lady, informcd her of all he knew, n0t only with r egard to hor daughter, but cllso concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his eomplete assent to a separatj0n; but did not hintany svspician of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interpasition.\nHaving 1eft Rome, Aubrey dirocted his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himsels at Athe ns. He then fixed his residence in the bouse of a Groek; and soon occupied hiinself in tracing the faded records of aricient glory upon monuments lhclt clpporently, afhamed of ohronic1ing the deods of freemen onIy beforo slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under thc fame roof as himse1f, existed a bein g, so beautiful and delicate, that she might havc formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithfvl in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke t0o muchmind for any one to thirik she could belong to those who had no souls. As she donced upon the plain, or tripped along thc mountain's side, one would have thought the gazolle a poor type of her beauties; for who wauld have exchanged her oye, opparently the eyc of animated naturc, for that sleepy luxurious look ofthe onimal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ionthe often accompanied Auhrey in hiſ seareh after antjquities, and often would the uncanscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her forrn, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almoſt effaced tablet, in the oontemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofton would her tresses fcllling, as she flitted around,exhl6it in the sun's ray such do1icalely brilliant and fwlftly fading hues, it mighl well excuse the forgetfulneſs of the antiquary, who let escape frorn his mind the very object he had before thought os vital importance to the proper interpretation of cl passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to descri be charms whioh all feel, but rione can appreciate?—It was innocencc, youth, and beavty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst ho drew those remains os which hc wiſhed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she wovld stand by, and watch the magic esfects os his pencll,in tracing the scenes os her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would pairit, to him in aIl the glowing oolours of youthful memory, the rnarriago p0mp she remembered viewing ln her infancy; and then, turning to suhjects that had evidently made a greclter impressiori upon her mind, would tell him all lhe supernatural lales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent helief of what she narrated, excited the interest cven of Aubrey; and often as she lold him lhc ta1e of the living vompyre, wbo had passed years clmidst bjs friends, and dearest tieſ, forced every year, by fcedingupon the life of a l0vely fomole ta prolong hif existence for the ens uing months, his blood would ruri oold, whilst he clttempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fontasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among tbemselvos, af ter several of their near relatives and children had bcen found marked wlth the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and wben she f0und him so incredulous, shc begged 0f hiin to believe her, for it had beeri, remarked, that those wha had dared to questlon their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detajled to him the traditional appcclrance of these monsters, and hls horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthucn; he, howcver, still pcrsisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wanderedat the many cojncidences which had all tended to excite a belief jn tho supernatvral power of Lord Rulhveri.\nAubrey began to attach himself more andmore t0 Ianlhe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affeeted virtues of the women among whom he had sought for hls vision of romonce, won his heart; and wbile he ridiculed the idca of a young man af English hahits, morrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself m0re and more attclched to the almost fairy form before hlm. He would tear himsels at times from her, and, forming a plan for ſome antiquarian research, he wo uld depart, determiried not to return until his object wos attained; but he alwayſ found itlmpossible to six his atlention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianlhe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; bul it was because she had no loriger any one wilh wham she could visit her favourile haunts, whjlst her guardian waſ0ccvpied in sketching or uncovcringsame fragment which had yel escaped the destructive hclnd of tjme. She had appealed t0 her parents ori the subject of Vampyres, and they botb, with several preſent, affirmed their existence, pale wjth horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proeeed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heord lhe name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass lbrough a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the reſort of the uampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most boavy evils as imponding upon him who dared t0 croſs thoir path. Aubrey made light of lhejr representatlonſ, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thuſ to mock a superjor, infornal power, the very name of which apparently made thoir blood frcez e, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set aff upon his excurfion unatterided; he was surprised to observe the molclncholy face of his host, and waſ coneerned to find that hjs words, mockjng the belief of those horrible fiends,bad jnſpired tbem with such terror. When he was about lo depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of hlm to rcturn, ere night allowod the power of these beings ta be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occvpied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-ligbt would saori end, arid that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, ſo rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, howover, mounted bis borse, determined to moke up by speed for hjs delay: but ll was loo 1ate. Twilight, ln these southern climates, ls almosl unknawn; immodiately lhe sun ſets, nighl begins: arid ere he had aduanced far, the power of the storm was clbove—its eohoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavyrain forced its way tbrough tho cariopying faliage, whilst the blue forked ligbtning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the eritangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he f0und, by the glare of lightning, that he was iri tbe neighbourhood af a havel that hard1y lifled itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brusbwood whicb surrounded it. Dismounting, he appr0ached, hoping to find some one to guide him to tbe town, or at Ieast trustirig to obtain shelter from the pelting os the st0rm. As he approaebed, the tbunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling wilh the stisled, exullant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startIed: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a svdden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkriess: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continucd, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contaetwith some orie, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succecded; and he felt himself grappled by orie whose strength seemed superhuman: dctcrmined to sell his Iife as dearly as he could, he strv ggled; bul lt was in vain: he was lifted from his seet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upori his breclsl, had placedhis harids vpon his throat—whcn the glare of many torches penetrating through tbe hole thal gave 1ight in the day, disturbed him;—he inslantly rose, and, leclving bis prey, rushed thr ough the door, and in a moment the crashjng of the branches, as hc broke through the wood, was no longer beard. The st0rm was now sti1l; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was saon heard by those witbout. They entered; the light of their torch es fell upon the mud walls,and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of s0ot. At the desire of Aubrey tbey searched for her who had attracted him by her eries; he was again Ieft in darkness; but whot was his harror, when the light of thetorches once more burst upon him, to perceive lhe airy form of his fair coriductress brought in a lifelcss corse. He shut his eyes, bopjng thal it was bvt cl vislon arising from his disturbed imaginatian; 6ut he ogain saw the same forrn, when he unelosed them, stretched byhis side. There was no colour upon her cheek, n0t even upon her lip; yct there was a stillnesf about her sace that seemed almost as attoching as tbe life that once dwelt there:—upon her rieckarid br east was blood, and upon her throal were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the meri pointed, crying, simultaneausly struck witb horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by tbe side of her who had lately heen to hirn the 0bjecl of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the fIower of life that had died within her. He knew not what bis thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflectlon, clnd take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particvlar construction, which had boon found iri the hut. They were soon met by differerit parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a inother had inissed. Their lamenta61e cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some drcadsul catastrophe. —To de scrjbe their grief would be jmpossible; bul when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was soized with a most vlolent feucr, and was often delirious; in these intervals he wouId call up0n L0rd Ruthven clnd upon Ianthe—by somc unaccountable cornbination he seemed to heg of his former companion to spare tbe being he loved. At othor times he would jmprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse hjm as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chancedat this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon heclring af the stateof Au6rey, immediately placed himsels in the same house, and became his constant attendanl. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, he wcls horrified and startled at the sjght of him whose image be had now combined with tbat of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their soparation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care wbich he showed, soon reconcilod him to his preſence. His lordship seemed quite ohanged; he no longer appeared that apalhetic beirig who had so astonished Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence bogon to be ra pid, ho again gradually retired into the sclme slclte of mind, and Aubroy perceived no differenee frorn tbe former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intenlly upon bim, with a smile of malicious exvltation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, bvt thjs smile haunled him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watchjrig the tideless waves raised by tbe coaling breeze, or in marking the progress os those orbs, circling, like our world, the move1ess sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish t0 avoid lhe eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was mvch weakened, and thal elasticity of fpirit wbioh had once fo distinguished hirn now seemedto have slod for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but inuch as he wished for salitvde, his mirid cauld not find it ln the neighbovrhood of Atbens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he hod formerly frequented, Iarithc's form stood by hls side—if he sought it in the wo0ds, her light step would appe ar wondering amidst tbe underwo0d, in quest of the modeſt violet; then suddcn1y turning round, would show, to his wild imagincltion, her paIe foce clnd wounded throat, with a meek ſmile upon her 1lps. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of whlch created sucb bitter associations in his mind. He proposed toLord Ruthucri, to wh0m he he1d himself bound by tbe tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that tbey should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet secn. They travclled in every direction, and sought euery spot to which a recollection could be attached:but though they thus haslencd from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed wbat they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, bul they gradually began to slight these reports, which they lmagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom lhey defended fr0m pretended dangcrs. In consequence of thuſ neglecting tbe advice of the inhabitants, on orie occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon enter-\ning, however, a narrow def-\nile, at the botlom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock 6roughl down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startlcd by the whlstling of bullets clofe to their hoads, and by the echoed report of sevoral gvns. In an instant thejr guardf had left lhem, and, placing themselvef bebind rocks, had begun to fire iri lbe direction wherice the report oame. Lord Ruthven clnd Aubrey, lmitating thelr example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed af boing thus detained by a foe, who wilh lnsulting shouts bade them oduance, and being exposed lo unreslsting slaughter, is ariy of the robbcrs shovld climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost tbe shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hclstened to his assistance; and, no longor hceding the contest or bls own peril, was soon surprised by sceing the rabbers' faces around him—his guards hauing, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, irnmediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to eonvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, hc was n0 more dislurbed by their presenee—they being content merely to guard the entrance till tbeir comrade should return wilh the pramised sum, for whicb he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortlficatlon ensued, and death feemed advancing with hasty stcps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; be seemed as unconsciouſ os pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the lasl ov ening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assjst me! you may save me—you rnay do more than that—I mean not my Iife, I heed the deoth of my existence as llttle as that of the passing day; but you may savc my honaur, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs opace—I cannot expIajri the whole—6ut if you wouldconceal all you know ofme, my horiour were free from stain in lhe wor1d's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall nat be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising hjmself with exultant violence, \"Swear by aIl your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, sor a year and a day you will not import your kn0wledge of my crimes ar death to any Iiving being in any way, whatever may happen, or whateuer you may see. \"—His eyes ſeerncd bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing uponhls pillow, and breathed no moro.\nAubrey retired to reſl, but did not sl eep; the many circumstances attending his acquairitance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering carne over him, as jf from the presentiment of something horribIe awaitinghim. Rising early in the morning, he was ab out to entor the hovel in which ho had left the corpse, when a ro6ber met him, clnd inforrned him thclt it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himsclf and comrades, upon hif retiring, to tbe pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, aeoording to a promisc they had giuen his lordship, that it should 6e exposed to the first eold ray of the moon lhat rose after his death. Auhrey aftonished, and taking several of the men, determined togo and bury it upon the spot whcrc it lay. But, when hc had moun ted to the summit he found no troce 0f either the corpse or thc clathes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the jdentical rock ori which they had laid the body. For a time bis mind was bewjldered in conjeclures, bul he at last returned, convinced thclt they had huried thecorpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a counlry in which he had met with such terrjble misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to hejghten that superslitious melancboly that had seized upon his mind, be res0lved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel lo oonvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to LordRuthven. Amongſt 0ther thirigs there was a case eontaining several weapons af affencc, mare or less odapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at sinding a shcoth apparently ornamented in the ſamestyle as lhe dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the wcapon, ond his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the fheath he held in his harid. His eyes seemed to need no fvrlher certclinty—they ſecmed gazirig to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbeljeve; but the particular form, the same varying tints vpon the haft and sheath were alike in splend0ur on b0th, and left n0 room for doubt; there were alsa drops of blood on eclch.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hiſ way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted ta snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she hod not been heard of since lhe departure of his lordsbip. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under fo mariy repeated horrors; he was afrajd that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He became mo rose and silent; and his only 0ccupatiori cansisted in urging the spoed os the poftilions, as if he were going ta save the lise of some ane he held dear. He arrived al Calais; a breeze, wbich seomed obcdient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastoned to the mansion of his fathers, and therc, for a momerit, appearod tolose, in the einbraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she besore, by her infantine caresses, had gained his asfectlon, now thclt the womari began lo appear, she was ftill inore attachingcls a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not thal winning grace whieh gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-r0om assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exifts in the heoted atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye wcls never lit up by the levity of the mind boneath. There was o melaricholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortvne, but from fome feeling within, that appeclred to indlcate a s0ul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not lhat light f0oting, which strays where'er a butterf1y or a coIour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. Wben alone, her fclce was nevcr brighteried by the smile of joy; but when her brother breothed to her hls affeeti0n, and would jn her presence forgct those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchonged her smile for that os lhe volupluary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet orily eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it hauing been thougbt by her guardians more fit that her presontation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, shou1d be the opoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed upon the melancholy which ovorpowered him. He could not feel interest about the friuolities os fashjoriable strangers, when his mind had been ſo torri by the eucnts he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protectiori of his sister. Thoy soan arrived in town, and prepared for lhe next day, which bad been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room bad not boen held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bosk in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Wbile ho wcls standing in a corner by himself,heedless of all around him, engaged iri thc remembrance that the firsl time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he fe1t himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he reeognized too well, sourided in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hard1y caurage to turn, fearfu1 of seeing a spectre that would blasthim, when he perceiued, at a little diſtance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into sooiety. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear lheir weight, hc was obliged to take the clrm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was drlven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from bis brain. Lord Ruthven agairi bofore him—ciroumstances started up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused hlmse1f, he could not beljeve il possible—the dead rise again!—He thovght his imagination had oonjured vp the imagc his mind was rest ing upon. It was impossible that it covld be real—he detormined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to osk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung vpon his lips, and he could not succecd in gaining information. He went cl few nightsafter with his sister to the assombly of a near relation. Leaving her urider the protection of a matron, he retircd into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring lhoughts.Perceiving, al 1ast, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering anolher room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in eamest conuersotion; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested ta move, turned round, and revealed to him those fecltures he moſt abhorred. He sprang f0rward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door hc found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wclitlng for their lords; and while he was engaged jri passing them, he agclin heard that voice whisper close to hirn—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reacbed home.\nAubrey became a1most distracted. If before hjs mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's liulng again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were naw unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her whot had caused his abrupl coriduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewjldered. His oath startled him;—was he then to aIlow this monster to roam, bearing ruin vpon bis breath, amjdst all he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touehed by him. But even if he were to break his oath, arid disc1ose bis svspiciorif, who wouldbelieve him? He tbought os employing his own hand to free the world from ſuch cl wretch; but death, he rcmembered, had beeri already mocked. For days hc reinained in thjs state; shut up in his room, be saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wha, with eyes streamlng with tears, besought him, for her sake, to ſupport nature. At lost, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, helest his house, roamed from street to stre-\net, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress becamc rieglected, and he wandered, as often exposod to the noon-day sun as to the rnidnight damps. He was no l0nger to be recognized; at first he returned with lhe everiing to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overloak bim. His ſister, clnxjous for his safety, employed people to follow bim; hut they were soon distanced by bim who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—srom thought. Hif conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by hif absence the whole of his friends, wlth a fiend ainongst tbem, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxiouf to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approacbed with intimacy. But when he entered inlo o room, his haggard and suspicious Iooks were so strlking, hiſ inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at laft obliged to beg of him to abstain froin sceking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrarice p r0ved unavailing, the gvardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mjnd was beeoming alienated, lhey thought it high time to resume again that lrust which had been before imposed upon thein by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the irijurjes and sufferings he had daily encountcred in his wandorings, and of preventing him fromexpofing to the generol eye those marks of what they considered folly, tbey engaged a physician to reside in thehouse, ond take conslarit carc of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, fo completcly wos his mind absorbed by ono terrible suhjeot. His incoherence beeame at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would oflen lie sor days, incapablc of being roused. He had become cmaciated, his eyes had attained o glassy lustre;—the only sign of affection and reeollection remairiing displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to t ouch him. \"Oh, do not tovch him—if your love for me is aught, do riot go near him!\" Wheri, however, she inquired to wbom be referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" ond again he sonk into a slate, whence not everi shc could rouse him. This Iasted many monthf: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences bocame less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whi lst his guardjans 0bserved, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, wheri, upon tbe last day of the year, one of his guardians entering hls room, began lo converse witb his physician upon the melanoholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awfvl a situation, when his fister was going next day to be married. Instontly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to wham. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared hc bad been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom hc had met with in society, Avbrey seemod pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis intention to hc present at the nuptiaIs, and dcsiring lo see his sister. Tbey answered not, but in a few minutes his sistcr was with him. Hc was apparently again capable of beirig affected by the jnfluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet witb tears, slowing at the thought of her brothor's being once morc alivo ta the fcelings of affoction. Hc began to speak wilh all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her vpon ber marriage with a person sa distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon ber breast; opening it, what was his surprise al b eholding the features af the mo nster who had so lorig influenccd hif life. He seized the p0rtrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled il under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblarice of her futvrc husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her bandf, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, be bade her swear that she would nevor wed this inonster, for he— But he could not advarice—it seemed as if lbat voice again bade him remcmber his oath—he turned sudderily round, thinking Lord Ruthuen wcls riear hlm bul saw no one. In thc meantime the guardians and physician, wha had heard tbe whole, and tbought this was but a return of his disorder, cntered, and forcing him from Mifs Au6rey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he irnplored, he begged of tbcm ta delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possessjon of his mind, erideavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvon had oalled the mornjng after the drclwing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard os Aubrey's ill health, he readily understo0d hlmsels to be the cause of lt; but whon he learned thclt he was deemed insarie, his exultation and pleasure could hardIy be coricealed from those among whom ho had gclined this information. He hostened ta the h0use of his former companion, and, by constanl attendance, and tbe pretence of g reat affection for the br0ther ond interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who cauld resist hif power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could spoak of himself as of an indiuidual h aving no sympathy with any heing on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himscIf;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preseruation, if it were mercly that ho rnight lislen to her soothing occents;—in fine, be knew so well how lo uſethe serpent's art, 0r such was the will of fate, tbat he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length t0 him, he obtained an important embassy, which se rved as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged slate,) which was to toke place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAvbrey, when he waſ left by the physielan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his ſister, corijurjng her, as she valued her own happiness, bor own honovr, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in lheir arms as their hope and the hope of their bouse, to delay but for a few hours lbat marriage, on which be denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought jt bettcr not to harass any more the mind os Miss Aubrey hy, what he oorisi dered, tbe ravings of a manioc. Night passed on wilh0ut rest to the busy inmates of thc house; arid Aubrey heard, with a horror that moy more eosily be eonceived than doscribod, the notes of husy prepclration. Morning came, and tbe sound of carriagef broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The cu riosjty of tbe servants clt last overcame thelr vjgjlance, they gradually stole clway, leaving him in the oustody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opp0rtunity, with one bourid was out of the room, and in a inoment found himself in the opartment where clll were nearly aſsembled. Lord Ruthven was the firſt to perceivo him: he immediately approachcd, ond, taking hif arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven wbispered in his ear—\"Remember your 0ath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, bad come in searcb of him. Aubrey could no longer ſupport himself; his rage not finding vent, bad broken a b1ood-vesse1, and ho was conveyed lo bed. Thif was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the pbyslcian was afraid of agitating her. Tbe marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegrooinleft London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be oalled, arid when the midnight hour had struck, he related cornposedly whclt the roader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened lo protect Miss Aubrey; bulwhen they arrived, it was too lclte. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of aVAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wasal1 before hirn, where to choose hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing thravgb tho Grecian Archipelago, on boclrd one of his Majcsty's vessels, iri the yearI812, we put into the harbour of Mit-\nylene, in the island of that namo. The beauty of this place, and tbe certain supply of cattle arid vegetables always t0 be had there, induce many British vessels to visit jt—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of thc track for ships bound to Smyrna, lts bountjesamply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whiIst the men wore employed in watering, and lhe purser borgclining for cattle wilh tbc ncltives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Scbool, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a sma ll monticule so named) we met with and engagcda young Greek as our gujde, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left tbe island fourdays prevjous t0 our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am Iikely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottageover the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has Ieft an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English eurreney,) and has resided thcre about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very oftcn to the differerit isIands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no lime in hastenjng to the h ouse where our countryman had reslded. We were kindly receivod by an old man, who conduct ed uf over the mansion. It consisted os four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall,a drawing-room, a sittingparlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closct annexed. They were al1 simply d ecorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tabl ef on either side, a lorge myrtle in the centre, and a smalI sountain beneath, whieh could be made to p1ay through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small brorize Vonus in a leclriing pofture; a large couch or fofa o0mpleted the furriiture. In thc hall stood half a dozen EngIish cane chairs, and an emply bo0k-case: there were no rnirrors, nor a single painting. Tbe bedchamber had merely a lorge mattresſ spread ori the f1oor, with two stvffed cotton quiltf and a pillow—the oommon bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, lhe old man told us, filled with books clnd papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest ln the clofet: it was open, but we did not think ourselvef justified in examiriing the contents. On the tablet of the reoess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimrnerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Mesſiah; Kotzebuc's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Ilalian edition, printed at Parma in l810; several small pamphlels from the Greek press at Constantinop1e, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of lhese books were filIed with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Ita1ian and Latln. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man sclid: \"The lord had been reading these boaks tbe evening hefore he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" sald he, \"there they must lie until his rctum; for he is so porticular, that were I to move onc thing withoul orders, he would frown upon ine for a week logelber; he isotherways very good. I once did him a service; arid I have the produce of lhis farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an oged Armenian who rcsides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the h ouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paoes long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black pIinths and fre-\nl-work comices, (as it is now customary in Grecjan arohilecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. Tbe roof, surrovnded by a li ght stone balustrode, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops arc thus surnished, as uponthem tbe Greeks pass their evcnings in smoking, drinking 1ight wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, clnd erijoying the evening breeze.\nOn tho left hand as we entercd the house, asmall streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and ljmes were clusterlng together on its borders, and under the shade of lwo large myrtle bushes, a marhle seatwith an ornameritaIwooden back was placed, on which we were told, the 1ord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelvo o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was uery devout, \"and always altended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a 6ird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyardsled the eye to Mount CaIcla, c0vered witb olive and myrt1e trees in bloom, and on tbe summit of which an ancienl Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins deſcended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshod0wed by a single eloud, terminates the view in front; and a litt1e an tbe left, througb a vista of lofty cbesnul and palm-trees, feveral srnall islands were distinotly observed, studding tho light blue waue with spots of emerald greeri. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitIess as to the name of the pers0n who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who hod gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could te1l, hut I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If Ican,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but 0n our retvrn to the town we learnt severa1 parliculars of the isolated lord. He had porlioned eight young girls when ho was last upon the island, and cven dariced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thogirls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and be often gave Greek Testaments to the poor childreri. In shorl, he appeared to us, from all we co1lected, to have been a very eccentric and benevo1ent character. One oircumſtance we leornt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclase. He had a rnost beautiful daughter, with whoin the lord was often seen walkjng on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her bimself the usc of it.\nSuch wos the information with which we departed from the poaceful ifle of MityIene; our imaginations all on the rclck, guessing who tbis rambler in Greeco could be. He hod money it was euident: be bad philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities wbich inark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our daubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupll 0f WYATT'S, wbo had boen travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the islclnd of Tcnedos, and I also visited him at Mlty1ene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been soine yearsfrom home; but \"Childe Haro1de\" being put jnl0 our hands wo recognized the recluse of C olcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret nothaving been moro curious in our researches at the eoltoge, but we consoled ovrseIves with the idoa of returning to Milylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I rnake this statement, believing it riol qujte uninterefting, and in justice to bis lordship's good nome, whioh hos been grossly slandered. He has been described as of anunfeeling disposition, averſe to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleosures. The foct is directly lhe reverse, as may be plainly gothered from these ljttle anecdotes. Al1 the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have thelr seat in his b0ſom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear lo gvide all his actions: and his oourting the repose of solitude is an additional reasori for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her soal, and ovor whose head Beneuolence hath lhrownher maritle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud os him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or p1easures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral inlegrity; and he who dares justify himfelf befarc that awful tribunal where alI must appear, alone may censure the errors of a sellow-m0rta1. Lord Byron'ſ character is worthy of bis gcniuſ. To do go0d in secrot, and shun the world's applause, is the sureſt testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGjllet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",

They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him.

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Johri WilIiam Polidori\nTHE superstition upon wbich this tale is foundod is very gcneral in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Greeks until after tbe establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its preserit sorm since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becomjng prevalent, tbat a Latin body could riot corrvpt if 6ur ied in their territory, it gradually increased, and sormed lhe subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of tbe dcad rising from thoir graves, and seeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread,with some slight variation, a1l over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whcre the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the b1ood of their victims, wbo became emclciated, loſt their strength, and spcedily died of consu mptions; whilst these human blood-suekers fattened—and their veins became distended to svch a stateof replotion, as to cause the bload to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even frorn the very pores of thoir skiris.\nIn tbe London Joumal, of March, I73z, is a curious, ond, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hung-\nary. It appears, thclt upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of tbe place, they positively arid unanimously affjrmed, that, about five years before, a ccrlain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the srontiers os the Turkisb Servia, be had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way torid himself of theevil, by eating some of the earth out of lhe vompyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prcvent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and bvrial, many persons complained of having been tormonted by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived os life byhis attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted thelr Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as is suppased to be usual in cases of vampyrlsm) fresh, and entirely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the inouth, riose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driveri entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported ta have cried out as dreadfulIy as if he had been alive. Tbis done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grove. The same measures were adopled with the corses of those personf who bad previously died from vampyrism, lesl they should, ln their turn, becomo agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked 6y o vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief hailiff.\nThiſ monftrouf rodomonlade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subjectof the preſent observations than any other instance which could be adduccd. In many parts of Greece jt is considered as a sort of punishmcnt after death, for some heinous crime committed wbilst in exiftence, thal thc deceased is not anly doorned to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visltations solely to those bejngs he loved rnost while up0n earth—those to whom bewas bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition o1luded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut firsl on earth, as Vainpyre sent, Thy corse sball from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natiue place, Arid suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathc the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livjd living co rse, Tby victirns, ere they yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; As cvrsing thee, thou eursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem. But orie that for thy crime mvst fall, The youngest, best 6eloved of al1, Shclll bless thee with a fathor's name— Thot word shclIl wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last linge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'or its lifeless blue; Thon with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's foridest pledgowos worn— But now is bornc away by thee Memoricll of thine agony! Yet with tbine own hest 6laod shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then stalking to tby sullen grave, Go— and with Govls and Afrits rave, Till lhese in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Tha1aba,\" the vompyre eorse os tbe Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as hauing returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in exiſtence. Bul this cannot be supposed to have refulted from lbe sinsvlness os her life, she bejng pourtrayed lhroughout the whole of the tale as a compIete type of purity ond innocerioe. The veracious Tourriefort gives a l0ng account in his lravels of several astonishing cases of vclrnpyrism, to which be pretends lo have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotos, and traditionary narratives illustrative of itſ effects, has put forth fome learnod dissertotlons, tending to prove jt to 6e a classical, os well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting noliees on lhis singularly horrible superstition might be added; thavgh the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deuolcd to explanation, and which may now be concluded hy inerely remarking, that tbough the term Vampyre is theone in most general acceptation, the re are several otbers synonymous wlth it, made use of in uarjovs partsof lbe world: cls Vroucolocha, Vardaulachcl, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London wlnter, there appeared at tbe various partles os the leaders os the ton a nohleman, more remarkable for his singulorities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could nol participate therein. Apparently, the lighl laughter of the foir only attractod his attention, that he might by a look qvell it, arid throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessncfs reigned. Those who felt this fensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixirig upon the object's face, did not seem to pe netrate, and at one glance to pierce through to tbe inward worklngs of the beart; but fell upon tbe oheek wlth a leaden ray that weighed upon lhe skin it could not pass. His peculiarities oauſed him to be invited to every house; alI wished to see hirn, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were ploased at having something in thejr presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue os his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blufb of modesty, or from the strong emotion os passion, lhough its form and ovtline were beaut iful, many of the female hunterſ after notoriety attempted to win his attentioris, and gain, at leaſt, some mclrks of what they inight term affection: Lady Mereer, who hod been the rnockery of every monstcr shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herfelf in his way, and did all but pul ori thc dresf of a mountebonk, to attract hls notice:—though in vain:—when she stood 6eforo him, though his eyes were apparcntly fixed upon ber's, stjll it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left lhe sield. But though the common adultress could not influence even tbe guidance os his eyes, it was not that tho female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caulion witb which be spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, thal fewknew he evcr clddressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputaliori 0f a winning longue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vlce, ho was as ofteri among thofe females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic vjrtues, os among those who su1ly it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name 0f Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an 0nly sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he waſ yet in chiIdhood. Left also tohimself by guardians, who thaught it thcir duty merelyto lake care of his fortune, while they relinquished lhe more important charge of bis mind to the careof mercenary subaltems, hc cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour arid candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed alI to sympathise wilh virtue, and thought that uico was thrown in 6y Providonce merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely corisisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irrcgular folds and various coloured patchef. He thought, in fine, that the dreams af poels were the realities of life. Hc was haridsorne, frank, and ricb: for tbese reos0ns, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth tbeir languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, arid by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, ſoon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attaobed as he was to the rornance os his solilary hours, be was start1ed at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles thcltflickered, not frorn the presence of a ghast, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundatiori in real life for any of that congeries of pleas-\ning picturesond descriptions contained iri those volumes, from which he had formed hiſ study. Fjnding, however, somc compensation in bis gratified uanjty, he was a6out to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above descrlbed, crossed him in his care er.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of f0rmirig an idecl of tbe character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, wbo gavo few other sigris of his observatiori os external objects, than the tacjt assent to their existence, implied by tbe avoidarice of thelr contact: allowing his imogination to pioture every thing thal flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romancc, and determlned to observe the offspririg of bis sancy, rather than the person before him. He becamc acquairited with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He grad ually learnt that Lord Ruthveri's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, froin the notes os preporation in — Street, thal he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this fingulclr cbaracter, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, thal it was tiine for him to perform the lour, which for many generat ions has been thought necesſary ta eriable the young to take some rapid steps in the ooreer of vice towards putting lhemselves uponan equality with the aged, arid not alIowing them to appear as if fallen from the skics, whenevor scandalouſ intrigues are mentioned as lhe subjects of pleclsantry or of prclise, clccording to the degree of skill shown iri cclrryjng thcm on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning hiſ intenlions to Lard Ruthven, was surprised to recelve froin him a proposal to join him. Flattered bysuch a mark of esleem from hlm, who, apparently, had nothing in common with othermen, he gladly accepled it, arid in a fewdays they had passed the circling waters.\nHithorto, Aubrey had had rio opportunity of studyirig Lord Rulhven's charaeter, and now he found, tha t, though many more of his actions were exposed to hls uiew, the results offered different concluſions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse iri bis liberalily;—the idle, the vagaborid, and the beggar, receiued from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon thevirtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed bis alms;—lhefe were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when lhe profligate carno to ask something, not to relieve his wanls, but to clllow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he waf sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to tho grcater imp0rtunjty of the vicious, whicb generally prevailf aver the retiring hashfulness of the virtuous indigont. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon wh0m it was bestowed, inevilably found thal there was a curse upon it, for they were clll either led to tbe scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and olher towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizod at the apparent eagerness with which hiſ companion sought for the centresof all fashioriabIe vice; lhere he entered into allthe spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled wilh success, except where the known ſharper was hjs antagonjst, and then he lost cven more tbon he gained; but it was always with the ſaine unohanging face, with which he generally watched the s0ciety arourid: it was not, however, so when he encounlered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a riumerous family; then his very wiſb seemed fortune's law—this appclrent abstractedness of mind waf laid clside, and his eyes sparkled with morefire than that of the catwhilst dallying with the ha1f-decld mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungean, tbe fate that had drawri him within the reach of thjs fiend; whilst many a father sat frantlc, amidst the speaking loo ks af mute bungry children, witbout a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficlent to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gamhling tablo; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he bad just snatched from lheconvulsive grasp of the innocent:thiſ might but be the result af a certain degree of knowledge, whicb was not, howevor, capable of combating the cunning of themoro expericnced. Au6rey often wjshed to represent thiſ to bis friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasvre which proved lhe ruin of clll, and did not terid to bis own profit;—but he deloyed it—for eacb day be hoped his friend would give him some apportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this riever occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich sceries os riature, was always the same: his eye spoke lefs than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he ohtained no greator gratificcltion from it than the coristant excitement 0f vainly wishing to break that inystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the clppearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his compariion; he left him in daily atlendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whi1st he wenl in search of the rnemorials of another almoſt deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrivod from England, whioh he operied with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter aſtonished him; if il had before enlered into his imaginotion that there was an ovil power resident in his companion, these ſeemed to give him sufsicie nt reason for the belief.His guardians insisted upon his lmmediately leaving bis friend, clnd urged, that his character was dreadfully viclaus, for that the posſession os irresistible powerf of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, thal his contempt for lhc adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that bls victim, the partner of his gvilt, ſhouId be hurled from the pinnacle os unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy ond degradati0ri: in flne, lhat all those semalef whom he had ſought, apparently on account of tbeir virtuo, hod, since his departure, thrown evcn the mask aside, and had nol scrupled lo exposc the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey detormined upon leavingorie, whofe eharacter had notyet shown a single bright point on which to rest tbe eye. He resolved to invent some plauſible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposlng, in the mecln while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight eircumslances pass by unnoticed. He entered inta the same circle, and soon perceived, that hif Lordship was e ndeavouring to work upon the inexperierice of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldoin that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his pla ns in secret; but Aubroy's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an asslgnation had beeri appointed, which would most likely end in the ruiri of an innocent, thougb thoughtlesſ gir1. Losing rio time, he entered the apartmenl of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him hjs intentions with respeet to the lady, informing him at the some time that he was aware of his being about to meel her that very night. Lord Ruthven clnswered, thathis inten tioris were such as he suppoſed a1l would have upon such an occasj0n; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, inerely laughed. Aubrey relired; and, immcdiately wrjting a note, to say, that from that moment he mvst decline accompanying his Lordship jn the remclinder of their propofed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and col1ing upon lhe mother of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard t0 her daughter, but also conceming the character of his Lordship. Tbe assignation was prevcnted. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servanl to notify bls complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey djrected his steps towards Greoce, and crofsing the Peninsula, soon fovnd hlmself at Athens. He theri fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the f aded records of ancient glary upan monuments that apparently, ashamcd of chronicling the deedſ of freemen orily besorc slaves, had bidden themselves beneath lhe sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as hiinself, existed a being, f0 beautiful and delicate, that sho inigbt have formed the modcl for a painter wishing t0 pourtray ori canvass the promjsed hope of thc fajthful in Mahomel's paradise, save lhat her eyes spoke too much mirid for any one to tbink she could belong to those who bad no fouls. As she dclnced upon the plaln, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who w0uld have exchangcd her eye, apparently tbe eyeof anjmated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the animal suiled but ta the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashrnere butlerfly, ſhaw the whole beauty of her form, floating as lt were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of hjm, who forgot the letters he had just decypbered upon an almost effaeed tablet, in the oontempIation of her sylph-like figvre. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitled arovnd, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the ontiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had besorc thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe chclrms wbich all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crawded drawing-rooms and stisling 6alls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wi shed to preserve a memorial for his future hourſ, she would stand by, and watch the magic effocls of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; sbe would then describe to him the circlirig dance upon tbe open p1ain, w0uld paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful momory, the marriage pomp she reinernbered viewing in her infancy; and tben, turnjng to subj ects that had evidently mclde a greater impression up0n her mind, would tell him all tho supcrnatural tales 0f her riurse. Her earnestness andapparent belief 0f what she narrated, oxcited the iriterest even af Aubrey; and often cls she told bim the tale of the living vampyre, who had pasfed yeorſ amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every ycar, by fceding upon the life of a 1ovely fernale to prolong his existence for the ensui ng months, hiſ blood would run co1d, whilst he attempted to laugb her out of such idle and horrible fclntasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among thomselves, after several of their near relatives and childron had beon found rnarked with the stamp of the fiend's appetlte; and when she found hirn so incredulovs, she begged of him to believo her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had somo proof givcn, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailcd lo him the traditional clppearance of theſe monslers, and his horrar waſ increased, by hearing a pretly accurate description of Lard Rutbven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, that tberecould be no truth in her fears, though at lhe same time he wondered at lhe mariy coinoidenceſ whjch had all tended to excito a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey b egan to attach himfelf more and more to Iantho; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtues of the women ainong whom he had sought for hif vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idecl of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, stjll ho found himsels more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hirn. He wovld tear hiinself at times from her, and, forming a plan sor some antiquarian refearch, he would depart, determined not lo return untjl his object was attained; but he always fovnd it impassible to fix his attention upon theruins around him, whilst in his mind he retoined an image that seemed alone the righlful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and wcls ever the same frank infantile being he had first knawri. She always seeined ta part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one wlth whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching 0r uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructiue band of time. She had appealed lo her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed lheir existcnce, pclle wlth horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed up0n one of his excursions, which was lo detain him for a few hours; wben they heard the name of lhe pl aee, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wo0d, where no Greek wovld ever remain, after tbe day had closed, upan any consideration. They described it as lhe resort of the vompyres in their noctvrnal 0rgies, and denounced the most heavy ovilf as impending upon hlm who dared tooross their palh. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idecl; but when he sclw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infe-\nmal power, the very name of which clpparently mode their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excvrsion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerried to find thal his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fierids, had irispired thom with such terror. When he was clbout to depart, Iarithe came to the side of his horse, and earnestIy hegged of him to relurn, ere night allowed the power of these beings to bc put jn action;—he promised. He was, howe ver, so occupied in his reseorch, thal he did not perceive that day-lighl would soon end, and that inthe horizon there was one of those spocks whieh, iri tho warmer climates, so rapidly gather into o tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon lhe devoted country.—He at 1clst, however, m0urited his horse, determined ta make up by speed for hiſ delay: but it was too late. Twiljght, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; irnmediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advancedfar, the power of the storm was abovc—its echoing thu ndors had scarcely an interval of rest—lts thick heavy rain forced its way through the oanopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightriing seeined to fall and rcldiate at his vcry feel. Suddonly his harse took fright, and he was carriod with dreadful rclpidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, throvgh fatlgue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of 1ightning, thal he was in the neighbovrhood of a hoveI that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some orie to guide bim to the town, ar at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingIirig with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbrokeri sound;—he was ſtartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, wlth a sudden effort, forced open the door of tho hul. Ho found bimself in utter darknoss: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unper-\nceived; for, lhough he called, sti1l the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He faund himself in contact with some one, whom he immedialely seized; when a voice cried, \"Agclin ba ffled!\" to wh ich a loud laugh succeoded; and he felt himself grappled by0ne whose strenglh seemed superhuman: determlned to sell his ljfe os dearly as he could, he struggIed; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet andhurled with enormous f0rce against the ground:—his enemy threw bimself upon him, and kneeling vpon his breast, hod p1aced his honds upon his throat—when the glare of mariy torches penelrat ing through the hole that gaue light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leavi ng his prey, rushed through the door, andin a moment the crasbing of the branches, as be broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapablc of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torchos fell vpori the mud walls, arid the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the dosire of Aubrey they fearched for her who had attrclcted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the lighl of the torches once more 6urst upan hiin, to perceive the airy farm af his fair conductress brought ln a lifeless corse. Ho shut his eyeſ, hoping lhat it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imclginati0n; but he again saw the some form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was nocolour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet therc was a stillness about her face that seemed almosl as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upori herthroat were the marks 0f t eeth havlng opened the uein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneovsly strvck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Varnpyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the objeot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lifc that hod died within her. He knew nat what hif thoughts were—his mind was 6enumbed and seemed to shvn refleetion, and take refuge in vacancy—ho held almost unconsciously in hiſ hand a naked dagger of a particular constructjon, whieh had been found iri the hul. They were soan met by diffcrent parties who had been erigaged in the search of her whom a mother had missod. Their lamentable cries, as they approaehed the city, forewarned tho parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe tboir grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained lhc cause of their obild's death, they looked at Aubrey, clnd pointed to the eorse. They wcre inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and wcls often dolirious; in these intervals he would call vpon Lord Ruthven and up0n Ionthe—by some unaccountclble combinatjon he seemed to beg ofhis former cornpanion to spare the being he loved. Al other times he would imprecote maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from wbatever motive, upon heorlng of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same houſe, and bccame his constant attcndant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and start1ed at the sight of him whose jmage he had now combiried with thot af a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, lmplying almost repentarice for the fault that had caused lheir separation, and stil1 more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite ehangcd; he no longer appeared that apathetic being wha had so astonjshed Aubrey; but af soon as his convaleſcence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mjnd, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except tbat at times he waſ surprifed to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, wilh a smile of malicious oxullation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this fmile haunted him. During the lclst stage of the inualid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently ongaged in watching the tide1ess waves raised by thc cooling breeze, or ln marking the progress of thoso orbs, circling, like our world, the movelefs sun;—indeed, he appeared to wifh t0 avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's inind, by this shock, was rnuch weakened, and that elasticity of spiril wbich bad once so distinguiſhod him now seemed to houe fled for ever. He was now as much a lovcr of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished f0r solitude, his mind could not find jt in lhe neighbourhood of Atheris; if he sought il amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianlhe's form stood by his side—if he sovght il in the woods, her ljght step would oppear waridering amidft the underwood, in queft of tbe modest violet; then suddenly turnirig rovnd, w0uld sh0w, to hif wild imagination, her palc face and w0unded throat, with a meek smile vpori her lips. He determinod to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assocjations iri his mjnd. He praposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during hif illness, that they shouldvisit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in euery directian, and sought every spot to whioh a recollection could bo attached: but thougb they thus hastcncd from placc to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upori. They heard much of robbers, but they graduolly began to slight these reports, whicb they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the gerierosity of those whoin they desended from pretended darigers. In conseqvence of thus neg1ectirig the advice of tho inhabitants, on one 0ccasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, bowever, o narrow defile, at the 6ottom of which was tbe bed of a torrent, with large inasses of rock bravghl down from the neighbouring prccipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; farscarcely were the whole of thc party engoged in the narrow pass, when thoy were ſtartled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echood report of several guris. In an instant their guards hcld left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in tho direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired sor a moment behind lhe sheltering tvrnof the defile: but clshamcd of being thus detainodby a foc, who with insulting shouts bade them a dvarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers fhould climb above and take them in the rear, they detormined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly bad they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven reoeived a shot in the shovlder, which brought him lo the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no loriger heeding the contesl or his own peril, was soon surprised by seejrig the robbers' faoes around him—his guards having, upon Lord Rvthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendcred.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded frlend to a neighbouririg cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presenco—they 6eing content inerely to guard the entrance till thejr comrade should returri with the promised sum, for whioh he had an ordor. Lord Rutbven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortisication ensued, and death seomed advancing with basty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of paln as he had been of the objects aboul him: but towards the close of the last evcning, hls mind became apparontly uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was iriduced to offer bis assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you maydo more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as l ittle as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honovr.\"—\"H0w? tell me how? I wovld do any thirig,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need hut little—my life ebhs apace—I cannot explain tbe wh0le—but if you would co nceal all you know of me, my bonour werc free from stain in the warld's moulh—and if my death were uriknown for soine time in Englond—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself wilh exu1tant violcnce, \"Sweor 6y aIl your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death t0 any livirig being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillaw, arid breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; lhe many circumſtonces attonding his acquaintancc with this man roſe upon his mind, andhe knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiverlng came over him, as if froin the presentiment of something horrible awailing bim. Rising eorly in the mornlng, he waſ about to enter thc hovel iri which he had left lhe corpse, wben a robher met him, ond informed him tbat it was no longer there, having been conueyed by himself and comrades, up0n his retiring, to tbe pinnacle of a neigbbouring inourit, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the sirst cold ray of the moon thot rose after bis death. Aubrey astonished, and taking severaI of tbe men, d etcrminod to go and bury lt upon the ſpot where it Iay. But, when hc had mounted to the summit he found no trclco of either thecorpse or the clothes, th0ugh the robhers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid theb0dy. For a timc his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relurned,convinced that they had burled the carpse for the sake of the clolhes.\nWeary of a country ln which he had met with such terrible misforturies, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstilious melancholy that had seizod upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived al Smyrna. While waiting for a vesfel to convey him to Otranto, or ta Naples, be occupied himself in arrariging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Amongst other thjngs there was a case containing scvera1 weapons of offerice, more or lesſ adaptcd to ensure lhe death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilsl turning them over, and examining tbeir curious forms, what was his ſurprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as tbe dogger discovered in lhe fatal but—he shuddered—hastening to gain furtber proof, he sound lbe weapon, clnd his horror may bc imagined when he discovered that it fitted, t hough peculiarly shaped, the shealh he held in his hand. His eyef seemed to nced no further certainty—they seernod gazing to he bound to the dagger; yet still hc wished to disbelieve; bvt the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on bath, clnd left no room sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left S myrna, and on his way home, clt Rome, his first lnquiries were concerning the lady he had atte-\nrnpted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivc orlf. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and fhe had not 6eenbeard of since the departure of his lordshjp. Aubrey's mind becarne almost hr0ken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iantbe. He becarne morose and silerit; and hiſ only 0ccupation consjsted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if bo wcre going to save the lifc of fome one he beld dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to hjs will, soan wafted bim to the English sbores; and hehastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momcnt, appeared to losc, in the embraees and caresses of his sister, all inemory of tbe past. If she before, by her infanline caressef, had gcliried his affection, now that the woman began lo appear, she was stjll more attaching cls a companion.\nMiss Aubrey bad not thot winning grace which gains tho gclze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmont. Her blue eye wcls never lit up by the levity of the mind berieath. There waſ a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misforturie, but fromsome feeling within, that appeared to indicate a foul conscious of a hrighter realm. Her step was nol tbat light fo0ting, which strays where'or o butterfly or a colour may attract—lt was fedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brather breathed to her bis afsection, and would in her presence forget thoſe griefs she knew destroyed bis rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that af the voluptuary? It seemed as if tbose eyes,—that facc were then playing in the lighl of tbeir own nalive sphere. She was yel only eighteen, arid had not been presentcd to the world, it having been thought 6y her guardians more fit that her presentation shouId be delayed until her brother's return from thc continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, rosolved thal the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, sh0uld be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his sathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered hirn. He covld not feel interest abouttbe frivolities os fashi-\nonable strangers, when his rnind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comsort to the protectionof bis sister. They s0on arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had nat been held for a long time, and all who were anxious lo bask in the smi1e of royalty, hastened thjther. Aubrey was there with hif sister. While he waf stariding in a c0rner 6y himse1f, heedless of all around him, engaged in the rememhrance that the first time he hod seen Lord Ruthuen was jn that very place—be felt himself suddenly scized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sourided in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had bardIy courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectrc thot would blost him, when heperceived, at a little distance, the some figure wbich had attracted hiſ notice on this spot upon his first eritryinto society. He gazed till hjs limbs alm oſt refuslng to bcar their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a frjend, and forcirig a passage lbrough the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were 6ursting from his brclin. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstancos started up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused hlmseIf, he could not belieue it possible—the dead rise again!—He thougbt his imagination had conjured up the irnage his mjnd was resting upon. It was imp ossible tbat it covld be real—he determined, therefore, ta go again into society; for though he altempted to ask eoncernirig Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his lips, and he eould not succeed in gaining iriformation. He went a few nigbts after wilh his sister to lhe assembly of a near relatlon. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, andthere gave bimself up to his awn devovring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leoving, he r0used himself, and entering anather room, found his sisler surrouridod by several, apparently in earnest conuersaliori; he attemptod to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, ond revealed to him tbose features hemost abhorred.Hc sprang forwclrd, sei2ed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, foroed her towards the stroet: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of servants who were waitlng for their lords; and while he was engagcd inpassing them, he again heard that voice whisper clase to hiin—\"Remernber your oatb!\"—He did not dare to lvrn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached horne.\nAubrey became aImost distracted. If besore his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complete1y was it erigrossed, nowthal the certointy of the monster's 1iving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sisler's attentionswere now uriheeded, and il was in vain that she intreated him to explairi to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only ultcred cl few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starlled hirn;—was he then to allow this rnonster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, arnidst all he held dcar, and not avert its progress? His very sistor might have been touched by him. But even if he were ta break his oath, and discl0se his suspioions, who would believe him? He thought of employing hjs own hand to free the world fram such a wretch; but death, he remembered,had been alreody mocked. For days he remained ln this slate; shutup in his room, he saw no one, clnd ate only when his ſister came, wbo, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support naturc. At laſt, no longer capableof bearing stlllncss and solitude, he lefl his houso, roamed from street ta street, anxi0us to fly that image wbich haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midriight damps. He was no longer to be recogriized; at first he returned with the evening lo the bouse; but at last he laid him down to rest wherover fatigue overtook him. His sister, arixious forhis ſafety, employod people to follow him; but they were soon diftanced by him who fled from a pursver swifter than any—from thaught. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose prescnce they were unconscious, he determjned to enter again into s0ciety, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spjte of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intlmacy. But when be entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so ulsible, thot his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her s oke, a society which affected him so strorigly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to iriterpose, and, fearing lbat hiſ mind waſ becoming olienated, they thought ithigh time to resume again that trust which hod been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving him from the injuries and sufferingſ he had daily encountered in his wariderings, arid of preventing hjm from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged o physician to reside in the house, and tako conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so complotely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His iricoherence becamo ot last so great, that he was canfined to his chamber. There he wov1d oflen lie for days, inoapa6le of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affeotion and recolleotion remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his f ister; then he would sometiinesstart, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her nat to touch him. \"Oh, do not t0ueh him—if your love for me is augbt, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his orily answer was, \"True! trvo!\" and again he sank into a state, whencc not even she could rouse him. This lasted many manths: gradua11y, however, cls the year was passing, his incoherences became less frcquent, and his mind lb rew off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guordians observed, that several times in the dcly he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tirne had nearly elapsed, when, upon the laslday of the year, one of his guardians cntering his room, bcgan to converso with his physicicln upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attentjon was atlracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad os this mark of returning intellect, of which thcy feared he bad been deprived, they montionod the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Au6rey seemed pleased, and astonished tbom still more by his exprcssing his jrilention lo he present at the riuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answored not, 6ut in a few minutef his sister was with him. He was apparently again capablo af being affected by the influerice of her louely smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, ond kifsed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak witb all his wonted warmth, and to congratuIate her upon her marriage with a perfon so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what wos his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her asking bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her fvture hushand, he looked as if he did nol understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with cl sraritic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would riever wed this monster, for he— But he could riot advance—it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember hls oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of hls disorder, cntered, and farcing him from Miss Aubrey, dcſired her to leave him. He sell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of lhem lo delay hut for one day. They, attribvting this to the insonity they imagined had taken posscssion of his mjnd, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the mornlng after the drawing-room, and had been refused with euery one else.When he heclrd of Aubrey's ill health, he readily vnderstood himscls to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deeined irisane, his cxultation and p1easure could hardly be coricealod from those among whom he had gainod this information. He hastened to the house of his f0rmer companion,and, by constant attendance, and the pretence af great affeclion for lhe brother and interest inhis fate, he grodually won the ear of Mifs Av6rey. Who could resisl his power? His to ngue had dangerſ ond toils torecount—could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no fympathy witb any being on the crowded earth, sclve with her to whom he addressed himself;—couId tcll how, since be knew her, his exislence, had begun to seem worthy ofpreservation, if it were inere1y that he might liston to her saothing accenls;—in fine, he knew so woll how to use lhe ferpent's art, 0r such was thc wilI of fate, that he gained her affectioris. The lit1e of the elder branch sallingat length to him, he 0btained on important embassy,which served as an excuse sor hastening the marrjage, (jn spite of her brother's deranged stato,) whjch was to take place the vcry day beforc his departure for lhe continent.\nAubrey, whon he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and papcr; it was given him; he wrote a 1elter to bis siſter, coniuring her, as ſhe valued her own happinefs, ber own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and thehope of their house, to de1ay but for a fcw hours that marriage, on which he denounced the mostheavy cursos. The seruantf promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he tbought it betternot to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what be considered, the ravings of a maniac. Nighl passedon without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that rnay more casily be conceiued than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of cclrriages brokc up0ri hiſ ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity 0f the servants ot last overcame their vigilanee, they gradually stoIe away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old waman. He soi2ed the opportunity, with one bound wos out of the room, andin a rnomentfound hlmself in the apartment where all were nearly asfembled. Lord Ruthven waſ the first to perceive him: ho immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried hjm from the raom, speech1ess with rage. When ori the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his e ar—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Wamen are fraiI!\" So sclyjng, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, bad come in search of bim. Au6rey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed lo bed. This was not mentioned lo hiſ sister, who was riot prefent when be eritered, as the physician was afraid of agitatirig her. The marrjclge was solemnized, and the b ride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakriess increased; thc effusi0n of blood produced symptomſ of the near approach of deatb. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader hos perused—he djed immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Au6rcy's sister had glutted lhe thirſt of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, C0NTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The warld was all before him, where to choose his p1ace of rest, and Providenco his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one 0f his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in tbe island of thot name. Tbe beauty of this placc, and the certain supply of catlle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and mercharitmen; and though it lies rather out of lbe track for shi ps bourid to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilft the men were employed in watering, and the pursor bargajning for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had beenhcforo. On the brow of Mount Ida (a sma1l monticule so named) wo met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mity1ene, whe re I am likely lo get married. He was an odd, but a very good mon. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, be1ongs lo him, and he has left on old man in charge of it: he gavo Dominick, the wirie-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there a6out fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felvcca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost na time iri hastenjng to tbe house where our countryman had resided. We wero kindlyroceived by an old man, who conducted us over the mansiori. It conſlsted of fovr apartments on the ground-flo0r—an enlrance hall, a drawing-rooin, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simpIy decorated: plain green-stclined walls, marble tables on cilber side, a large myrtle in thecentro, and a small fountain beneoth, which covld be mode to play lhrough the branches by moving a spring sixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a largc couch or sofa completed the furniture. In thc ha1l stood haIf a do2en English cane cbairs, and an einpty book-case: there wero no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on tbe floor, with twa stuffed cottori quilts and a plllow—the common bcd lhroughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled wlth books and papers, which were theri in cl large seclman's chest in the cIoset: it was open, but we did not think ourselvcs justified in exainining the contents. On thc tablet of the recess 1ay Voltajre's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volncy's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Gerrnan language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's riovels; Sehiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets srom the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no Engljsh book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, writtenwith a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all 0ver, arid inarked with sljps of paper, on which a1so were remarks.\nThe ald man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sail-\ned, clnd forgot to place tbem with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie unlil bjs return; for he is so p ortlculor, that were I to move one tbing withovt orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I onco did him a service; and I have the producc of lhjs farm for tbe trouble of taking care os it,exeept twenty zechines which I pay to anaged Armenian who resides in a small cottage iri the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for wbat reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externa1ly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen brood, and lhe fluted marble plllars with block plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were conſiderabIy higher than the roof. The roof, surr0undedby a light stone balustrado, waſ covered by a firie Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the hovse-lops are thvs furnished, as upon them the Greeks paſs their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, suchas \"lachryina chrisli,\" eating fruit, arid enjoying the evening bree2e.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small slr-\neamlet glidcd away, grapes, orariges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bufhes, a marble seat wlth an ornamental wooden back was placed, on whjch we were told, the 1ord pclssed many of his evenings clnd nigbts till twelve o'clock, reading, wrjting, and talkirig to himseIf. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout,\"and always atterided our chvrch twico a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThc view fr0m thiſ seat was what may 6e tormed \"cl bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led tbe eye to Mount Calcla, covered with oli ve and myrtle trees in bloom, and on thc summit os which an ancicnt Greek tcmple appeared lri majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descendcd in broken cascades, until it was lostin the woods near the mountain's baſo. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminateſ the vjew in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly obserued, studdirig the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed o view more than I did this; but our enqujries were fruitless as lo the name of the pe rson who had resided in thjs romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, bis bankor, who had gone lo Candia. \"The Armen ian,\" said our conductor, \"could tel1, but I am sure he wjll not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, o1d friend?\" faid I—\"If I can,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particularf of the ifolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls whon he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. Ho gave a cow to one mon, horses to others, and cotton and silk to lhe girlſ who live by weaving theſe articles. He also bovght a new boat for a fisherman who bad lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testarnerits to the poor child ren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to hove beena very eccentric and benevolent characler. One circumstance we learnt, whjch our old friend al the cottago thought propcr not to discIose. He had a most beautiful daughler, with whom tbe lord was often seen walking on the sea-shoro, and he had bought her a piano-s0rte, and taugbt her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infarmation with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylone; our imaginatlons all on lhe rack, guossing wh0 this rambler in Greece could bo. He had rnoney it was evident: he hod philanthropy 0f disposition, arid all those ecoentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriued at Palerm0, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupi1 of WYATT'S, who had 6eenlravelling in Egypt andGreece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so arixious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the islclnd of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then hcard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some yeors from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recIuse of Calcla ln every page. Deeply djd wc regret not having been more curiovs in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will riever return. I mclke thisstatement, believing it riot quite uninleresting, and in justice to his Iordship's good namc, wbieh has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as os an unfceling disposition, averse lo associating with human nature, or contribvting in any way ta sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the rcverse, as may be plainly gathered from theselittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of lhe heart, so elegclntly depicted jn hls lordsbip's poems, scem to bave their seat in hls boſom. Tenderricss, sympathy, and charity appear t0 guide all his actioris: and his courting the repose of solitude is an odditional reason for marking him as a beirig on whose heart Religian hoth set her scal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown ber mantle. No inan ecln read the proceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud afhim af a countryman. With respect to his l0ves or pleasures, I do not assvme a right ta give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caulion, particu larly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure lho errors of a fell0w-mortal. Lord Byron's character iswarthy of bis genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous beart and solf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleel-streel.",
    "clean": "Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy JohnWilliam Polidorj\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is faunded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabians jt appoars to be common: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Grecks until afler the eſtablishmenl of Christjanity; arid it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek chvrches; at which lime, the idea becomlng prevalent, that o Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed lhe subject af many wonderfvl stories, ſtill extant, of the dead rising from thejr graves, and feoding upon the blaod of the young ond beautjsul. In the Wost it spread, witb some slight variation, all over Hurigary, Poland, Auslria, and Lorraine, where the helief existod, that vampyres njghtly imbibed a certainportion of the blood of their victims, wbo became einaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human 6lood-suckers sattened—and their velns became distended lo such a state of repletion, as to ccluse the blood to flow from all the paſfages 0ftheir bodics, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn thc London Jaurnal, of March, 1732, is a curlous, and, of course, credible account of a particvlar case of vampyri-\nsm, whicb is stated to have 0ccurred al Madreyga, in Hungary. It oppears, thal upori ari examiriation of the eommander-in-chief and magistrales of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named A rnold Paul, had 6een heard to say, that, at Cofsovia, on the fronliers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, bul had found a wclyto rid himself of the evil, by eating some of tho earth 0ut af the vainpyre's graue, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaulion, however, did nol prevent him from becoming a vampyre himsclf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complairied of having been tormented by hjm, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been dcprived of Iife by his attacks. To p reuenl surther mischief, the lnhabitants having consulted lheir Hadagni, took up the 6ody, and found il (as ls supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof havi ng been tbus obtained, they resorted t0 the accustomedremedy. A stake was driven entirely through the hcart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had boen aliue. This done, they cut aff his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopled with the corses of thoſe persons whobad previously died from vampyrism, lest thoy sbould, in tbeir turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a uampyre himſe1s, and sucks iri his lurn.\nChief bai1iff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better odapled to illustrate the subjcct of the present observotions than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishmerit after death, for some heinous crimo committed whilst in exiftence, that the deceased is not only dooined to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to lhose beings he loved most while upon oarth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindr ed and affection.—A supposilion alludcd to in tbe \"Giaour.\"\nBut firston earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse sholl from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the ftreain of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid ljvirig corse, Thy victims,ere they yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are wltbered on the ftem. But one tbat f0r thy crime must fall, The youngest, best belovedof all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—hcr eye's last spclrk, And the last glassy glance must view Whicb freezes o'er its lifcless blue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Df which, in life o lock when shorn Affeotjon's fondest pledge waf worn— But now is bome away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shclll drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then sta1king to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Ti1l thesc jn horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey has also intr0duoed in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre oorse of the Arabian inajd Oneiza, wh0 if represented cls having returned frorn the grave farthe purp0se of tormenting him she best lovedwhilst in exislence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted froin the sinfulness of her Iife, she being pourtrayed throvghout the whole of the tale as a complete type os pur ity and innocence. Tbe veracious Tournefart giues a long account ln his travels 0s severaI astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretendf to have beeri on eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a va riety 0f anecdotes, and lraditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prave it to be a classical, as well as harbaricln error.\nMany curiovs and interesting notices ori this singularly horrible superstiliori might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, nccessarily devoted to explanation, and wbich may now be concluded by merely remarking, that tbough the term Varnpyre is the onc in most general acceptation, there are seueral olhers synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocba, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened lhat in tho midst of the dissipations ottendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of lhe leaders of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularitles, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, lhe llght laughter of the fair only attracled his attention, that he mighl by a look quell it, and tbrow fear into tbose breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this fenscltion of awe, could not explain whence it arose: somo attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object'f face, did not seem to pcnetrate, and at one glance topierco tbrough lo theinward workings of the heart; but fell upon thc cheek with a 1eaden ray that woigbed upon lhe skin it cauld not pass. His peculiaritios caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustamed to violenl excitement, and now fe1t the weight of ennuj, wore pleased at hauirig something ln their presence capable 0f engagjng their attenlion. In spitc of tho deadIy hue of bis face, which never galneda warmer tint, either from the hlush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, lhough ils forin and outllne were beautiful, many of the female hunlers after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of wbat tbey mighl term affectiori: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe mockery 0f evory monster shcwn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but pul on thc dress of a movntebank, to clttract his notiee:—though in vain:—whon fhe stood before him, though biſ eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—evon her unappalIed impudence wcls baffled, and she left the field.But though the common aduItress cou1d not infIuenco even the guidanoc of his eyes, it was not that thc femole sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which be spoke tothe virtuous wife and lnnocent daugbter, that few knew he ever addressed hjmself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and whether it was that il even overcame the dread of his singular character, 0r that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, bo waſ cls often among lhose females who form the boast os their sox from their domestic virtues, as among those who svlly it by their vices.\nAbout thc same time, therc came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in tho possession af gr eat wealth, by parents who died wbile he was yet in childbood. Left olso to himself by guardiclns, who thought il their duty merely to take care of his forlune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenory subalternſ, he cul tivated more hjs imagination than his judginent. He hcld, hence, that high romantic fee1ing of bonour and candour, which daily ruins so many milllners' apprenticef. He belioved a1l to sympathife wjth virtue, and lhought lhal vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the soene, as we see in romances: he thought tbat the misery os a cottage merely consisted jn the vosting of clothes, which were as warm, but whicb were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and vorious coloured patohes. He thought, in firie, tbat the dreams of poetf wero the realities of life. He was handsome, frank,and rich: for these reosonf, upon his enterjng irito the goy circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving whjcb sbou1d defcribe with leasl truth lheir languishing or romping favovrites: the daughters al the same time, by lheir brightening countenances wheri he approaehed, and by their sparkling eyef, when he opened his lips, soon led him into falfe notions of his talents clnd his merit. Attacbed ashe was to the romance of his solitary hours, he waf startled at firiding, that, except in the to1low and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of fnuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictu res and descriptions conlained in those volumes, from which he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compensatjon in his grcltified vanity, he was about to rolinquish his dreains, when the extraordinary being we have above descrjbed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; ond the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave fow olher signs of hjs observation of oxternal objects, than the tac it assent to tbeir existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginatlon to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon f ormed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to o6serve the offspririg of hiſ fancy, rather than the person before hiin. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was olways recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs werc embarrassed, and soon found, frorn the notes of prepara-\ntjon iri — Street, that he was about to t rave1. Desirous of gaining some insormation respecting this singuIar character, who, till now, hcld only whetted his curjosity, he hinted to his guardians, lhat it was time for him t0 pcrform the tour, which for many generations has becn thought necessory to enablo theyoung to toke some rapid steps in the caroor of vice towards pvtting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and riol al1owing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous jntrigues are mentioned as tbe subjects of pleasantry or of prclise, aocording lo the degrec of skil1 shewn in carrying them on. They consenled: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, wos surprised to receive from him a proposal to join bim. Flattercd bysuch a mark of esteem from hlm, who, apparently, hcld nothing in camrnon with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherta, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studyjrig Lord Ruthveri's cbaracter,and now he found, that, though inariy more of hif actions were exposed to bis view, the refults offered difforerit cariclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His compani0ri was profuse in his liberality;—the ldle, the vclgabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than en0ugh ta relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuouf, reduced to indlgen ce by the misfortunes attendant euen upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—lhese were sent from the door wjth hardly suppressed sneers; bvt when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lvst, or lo sink him slill deeper in his iniquity, he was sont away wilh rich charity. This waſ, however, attributed by him to tbe greator importunity of thc vicious, which generally preuclils 0ver the retiring bashfulnefs af the virtuovs indigenl. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upori whom il was bestowed, inevitablyfound that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the mast abj ect mifery. At Brussels and other towns throvgh which they passed, Aubroy waſ ſurprized at the apparent eagerness with which his compclniori sought for the centrcs of all fashlonable vico; there he entered into all the splrit of the fara table: he betted, and alwayf gamhled with svccess, except wherethe known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even moro than he gained; but it was alwclys with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around:it was not, however, so whon he encountered thc rash y0uthful novice, or the lvckle ss fclther of a numerous family; then his vcry wish seemed sortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind wclſ laid aside, and bls eyes sparkled with more fire than thclt of the cat whilst dallying with the h alf-dead mouse. In evory town, he left the formerlyaffluent youth, tom from the circ1e he adorned, cursirig, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a fathcr sat frantic, ainidst the speaking Iooks of mute hungry childreri, without a singlo farthing of his late immcnse wealth, wherewith to buy even svffieient to satisfy their present cravirig. Yet he took no money from lhe gambling table; bul immediately l0st, lo the ruiner of mariy, the last gilder he had just snatehed from tho c0nvuls ive grasp ofthe inriocent: this inighl but be the result of a certain degree of kn0wledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of themore experionced. Auhrey often wished to represent this to hjs friend, and beg him to resign that charity arid pleosure whicb provedthe ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; howevor, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild ond rich sconos af nature, was always the same: his eye ſpoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near tbe object of his curiofity, he obtainod no greater gratificcltion from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break tbat mystery, which to his oxalted imagination began to assume the appearance of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for o time lost sigbt of his c ompanion; he left him in doi1y attendance upon the mornjng ciroIe of an Italian countesſ, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrlved frorn England, which he opened with eager impatience; thefirſt was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the otbers were from his guardians, lhe latter ast0nished him; if it had before entered inlo his imagiriatiori that there wcls an evil power residcnt in his companion, these seeined to give him sufficient reason for the bolief. His gvardians insistcd upon hisjmmediately lcaving his friend, and urged, tbat his character was dreadfully vici0us, for that the possession as irresistible powers of sedvction, rendered his licontious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress hcld not originated in hatrod of her charactor; but that he had required, to enhance his gratisicatiori, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, s hould bc hurled srom lhepinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradalion: in fine, that aIl those females whom he had s0u ght, apparently on account of their virtue, had, sincc his departure, throwri even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the wh0le deformity of their vices lo the pu6lic goze.\nAubrey dcterinined upon leclving one, whose character had not yet shown cl singlo bright point ori which to rest the eye. Hc rosolved to lnuent some plausible pretext far abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more clasely, andto let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered intothe same circle, and soon perceivcd, tbat his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of lhe lady whose house he cbiesly frequented. In ItaIy, it is seIdom that an vnmarried female is met with in society; he was lherefore obliged to carry onhis p1ans in secret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignati0n had been appointcd, whjch wovld most likely end iri the ruin of an innocent, thovgh thoughtlcss glrl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruplly asked him hjs inten tions with respeclto the lady, informing him at tho same time that hc waſ aware af his being clbout to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended lo marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wrjting a note, to say, that from that rnoment he must dec line aceompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of clll he knew, not only with regclrd to her daughter, but also coneernlng the choracter af his Lardship. The assignation was prevenled. Lord Ruthven next dcly merely sent bis servant to n0tify his complete assent to a separation; bvt did not hint any suspicion of bis plans having been foiled by Aubrey'ſ interposition.\nHaving left Rame, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crofsing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in thc house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traeing the faded records of aricierit glory upon monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling the deods of freomen only before slaves, hcld hidden themselves beneath thc shellering sojl or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so bcautiful and delicale, thal sbe might have forrned the model for a pairiter wlshing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the fajthfvl in Mahamet's pclradise, save thclt her eyes spoke too much mind for any 0ne to think she could beIo ng to those who had n0 souls. As she danoed upon the plain, or tripped along the mouritain's side, one would hove thought the gazolle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, clpparently lhe eye of animatod nature, sor that sleepy luxurious l0ok of the animal suitod but to the taste of on epicure. The light step os Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in hls search after aritiquities, and often would theunconscious girl, engaged in the pursvil of a Kashinere buttersly, show the whole beauly of her form, floating aſ it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, wh0 forgot the letters he bad just decyphered uponan almost effaced tablet, in the contemplotion af ber sylph-llke sigure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such deljcately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the fo rgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape srom his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Paufariias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innoeence, youth, and beauty,unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling bal1s. Whilst he drew those remains of whjch he wished to preserve a memorial for bis future hours, she would stand by, and watoh the magie effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe ta him the circ-\nling dance upori tbe open plain, would paint, to him in al1 the glowing colours of youthful mcmory, the marriage pomp she remembercd viewing iri her infancy; and then, turning to subjeots that had evidenlly mclde a greater impression upon her mind, wou1d lell him all the svpernatural tales of her nurſe. Her earriestness and apparent belief of what she narroted, excited the inlerest even af Aubrey; and osten as she told him the tole of the living vampyr e, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest lies, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for lhe ensuing montbs, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idlc and h0rriblc fantasies; but Iclnthe cited ta hiin the names of old meri, wbo had at last detoctod one living among themselves, after several of their near relatjves clnd children had been faund marked with the stamp of the fiend's clppetite; and when ſhe found him so incredvlous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remclrked, that thosc who hod dared to question their existence, always had some proof giveri, whioh o6llged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to consess it was true. She detailed to him the traditlonal appearance of these monfters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pret ty accurate descrlption of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that thcre could be no truth in her fears, though clt the ſame time he wondered at tbe many coincidenoes which hcld all tended t0 excite o belief in the fupernatural power of Lord Ruthvcn.\nAubrey began to attaeh himself more and more to Ianlhe; her innoccnce, so contrasted with aIl the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sougbt for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed tbe idea of a young man of Engliſb ha6its, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himſelf more and morc attached to the almost falry form before him. He would toar himſelf at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, be would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible ta fix his altention upon the rvins oround him, whilst in his mind he relained an imago that secmed alone the rightful possessor of bis lhoughts. Iari the was unconseious of his love, and was ever the same frank irifantile being he had firft known. She always seomed to parl from him wilb reluctance; bul it was because she had no longer any one with whorn she could uisit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appea1ed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they 6oth, with seueral present, affirmed their existence, palc wjth horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon orie of his excursions, which was t0 detain him for a few hovrs; whcn they heard the name os the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at nighl, os he inust necessari1y pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, afler the day had c1osed, upon any consideration. They described it as the rosort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy eviIs as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to lclugb them out of lhe idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excurslon unattended; he waf surpriscd to observe the meloncholy face of his host, and was eoncerned to find lhat his wards, mocking the belief ofthose horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about t0 deparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earneslly begged of him to return, ere nigbt allowod the power 0f these bejngs lo be put in action;—he promised. He was, howeuer, so occupied in his research, tbat he did not pe rceive thal day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, ln the warmer climates, so rapjdly gather into a tremendous mass, and paur all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is olmost unknown; immediately the sun sets, nighl begins: and ere he hod advanced far, the power of the storm wcls above—its echoing thundcrs had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain farced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemcd to fall and radiate at his vcry feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through theeritangled forest. Theanimal al last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glclre of lightnirig, thal he wcls in the neighbourhood of a bouel thal hardly lifted jtself up from the masſes ofdead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismountirig, he approached, hoping to find sorne one to guide him lo the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, tho thunders, for a momerit silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shriekſ of a woman mingling with the stifled, cxultant mackery of a laugh, contiriued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by lhe thunder which again r0lled over his hoad, he, with a sudden effort, forced 0pen the door of the hut. He fourid hlrnself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continucd, and no notice was takeri of him. He fovnd himseIf iri oontact with samo one, whom he immediately feized; when a voice oried, \"Again haffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by one wbose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dear1y as heoould, he strvggled; but it was in vain: he was ljfted from his feet and hurled with enormovs force againſt the ground:—his enemy threw hjmself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands up0n his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole lhat gavo light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving hjs prey, rushed through the door,and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke lhrough the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They enlered; the 1lght of thejr lorches fell upon the mud wallf, andlhe thatch loaded on evcry individval straw with heavy flakes os soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted birn hy her cries; he was again left in darknesſ; but what was his horror, wheri the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his sajr conductress brought in a Iifeless corse. He shut hjs eyes, hoping that it was bul a uisi0n arising from his disturbed imagjnation; but he again saw the same form, wben he unclosed them, stretched by hiſ side. There was no colour upori ber oheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness ahout hor face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwell therc:—up0ri her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the inen pointed, crying, simultaneausly struck with horrar, \"A Vainpy-\nrc! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly farmed, and Aubreywas laid by the sidc of her who had Iate1y been to him the obiect of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower af life that had dicd within her. He knew not what his thoughts werc—hjs mind was benumbed and seoined to shun reflection, and take refugo in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a partjcular construction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon met by differerit parties wha had 6een engaged in the search of her whom a mather hod missed. Theirlamentable eries, as they approached the city, forewamod the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe thejr grief would be impossihle; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and pointed to tho corse. They were inoonsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these jntervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountab1e combination he seemed to beg of hjs former companion to spare tbe being he loved. At ather times he wo uld imprecate maledictioris upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, cbanced at this tjme to arriue at Athens, and, from whalever motiue, upon hearing of the ftclte of Aubrey, imrnediately placed himself in the same house, and became his conſtarit attendant. When the lotter recovered from his delirivm, he was horrified ond startlod at the sight of him whose image he had now combined withthat os a Vampyre; but L0rd Ruthven, by bis klnd words, implying almost repentance for the fault that hod cavsed tbeir separatian, and still inore by lhe attention, clnxiety, and care which he showcd, soon rec onciled him to his presence. His Iordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic belng who had so astonifhed Aubrey; but os ſaon as his c0nvalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceiued rio difserence from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gazc sixed jntently upon him, with a smjlo of malicious exultotion playing upon his lips: he knew nol why, but this sinile haunted him. During the last stage of the irivalid'ſ recavery, Lord Ruthvonwas apparently engaged in watcbing the tid eless waves raifed by the cooling breeze, 0r iri markirig the progress of those orbs, circling, like 0ur world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish t0 clvoid tbe eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which hcld once so distinguished him now seemed to bave fled for ever. He was now as mvch a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Rutbuen; but much as he wished for salitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Alhens; if he sought it amidst the ruinſ he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his ſide—if he sought it in lhe woods, her light ſtep would appear wondering amidst the underwood, in quest of the rnodest uiolet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to bis wjld jmagination, her pale face arid wounded thro at, with a moek smile upon her lips. He determined to sly scenes,every feature af which created such bitter associations in hismind. He proposed to L0rd Ruthven, to whom he heldhimself bourid by the tender care he had taken of hirn dvring his illness, thal they should visil th0se parls of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollcction could be attached: 6ut though they thus hclsteried from place to place, yet they seemed not t0 heed what thcy gazed upon.They heard much of robbers, but they graducllly began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, wh0se interest lt was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus neglecting the advjce of the inhabitarits, on one occasion they travelled with 0nly a fow guards, more to scrve as guides than as a defence. Upori entering, howover, a narrow defile, at tbe bottom of which was lhe bed os a torrent, with large masseſ of rock brought down from the neig hbouring precipices, they had reason ta repent their negligence; for fcorcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they wcre startled by the whistling of bullets close to thelr beads, and by the ec hoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselvcs behlrid rocks, had 6egun to fire in tbe direotion whence the rep0rt came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retircd for a moment behind the ſheltering turn 0f the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who wilh insultirig shouts bode them advanee, and being exp0sed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and lake them in the rear, they determinedat once to rush forword in sear ch of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven receiued a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistarice; ond, rio longer heedirig the contesl ar his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately tbrown vp their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbovring cabiri; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by tbeir presonce—they being cont ent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should returri witb the promised sum, for which he hcld an order. Lord Ruthven'ſ strerigth rapidly decreased; in two days inortisication ensued, and dea th seemed advancingwith hasty steps. His conduct and appearance bad riot changed; he sceined as unconsclous of pain as he had becn of the objects about him: but towards the cl0se of the last evening, his mind hecame apparently uneasy, orid his eye often fixed upori Aubrey, who was induced to offer hif assistance with more than usual earneslriess—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed tbe death ofmy existonce as little aſ that of the passing day; bul you may save my h ori0ur, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need bvt litlle—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all yau know of me, my honour were free from stairiin the world's mouth—and if iny dcatb were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be knowri.\"—\"Swcar!\" cried lhe dying man, raisirig himself with exuItant violence, \"Swear by all y0ur soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear lhat, for a year and a day you wjll n0t impart your knawledge of my crimes or death to any livjng6eing ln any way, whatever may bappen, or wbatever you may see. \"—Hiseyes ſeemed bursting from lbeir sookets: \"I fwear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk loughjng upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acqvclintanoe with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his aath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presenliment of somelhing horrible awaiting him. Rising ear1y in the morning, he wasabout to enter the hovel in whicb he had lefl the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been eonveyed by bimseIf and comrades, upan his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hjs lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray af the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking seueral of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he fourid no trace ofeither the carpse or the clothes,though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which theyhad laid thc body. For a tjme hif mlnd was bewildered in eonjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that lhey bad buried the oo rpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of o country in wbich he had met with such terrible misf0rtunes, and inwhich all appclrently oonspired to heighten that fuperſtitious melancholy that had sei2ed upon his mind, he resalved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whi1e waiting for a vefsel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had witb him bel0nging to Lord Ruthven.Ainongst other things there was a case conlaining several weapons of offence, more or less odapted to ensure tho death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst tvrning tbem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the saine style as the daggor discavered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hasteriing to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovercd tbat it fitted, thougb peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no furtber certainty—they soemed gazing to bo bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the hoft and ſh eath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood ori each.\nHe loft Sm yrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquirief were concerning the lady hc had altempled ta snalch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune rvined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's inind became almost broken vrider so many repeated horrors; he was ofraid that this lady had fallen a victim tothe dostroyer of Iantho. He became moroſe and silent; and his only occupalion consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if be were going ta save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted hjm to the Eng1ish shores; and he hastened to the mansi0n of his sathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces arid caresses of bis sister, all rnemory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a coinpanion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applauseof the drawing-room assemblies. There wos riorie of that ligbtbrilljancy which 0nly exists in the heatedatmoſphere of a crowded apartmerit. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levily of the mlnd beneath. Therc was a molancholy charm about it which did not seem toarife from misf0rtune, but from some feeling wjthin, thclt appeored to iridicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was nat that light footing, which ſtrays where'er a butter fly or a colour may attract—jt was sedate and penfive. When alone, her face wcls never brightened by the smile of joy; bvt when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her prefericc forget th0se griefs she kriew destroyed his rest, who would hove exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuclry? It feemed as if those eyes,—thal face were then playing in tbe light of their own native sphere. She was yeton1y eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it hoving been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brolher'ſ relvrn from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, thcrefore, resolved that the next drclwjng-room, which was fast approaching, should be lhe epocb of her entry irito the \"busy soene.\" Aubrey would ratber have remained in the mansion os his fatherſ, and fed upon the meIancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fa shionoble strangcrs, whcn his mind had been fo torn by the evenls be bad witnessed; but he determincd la sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of bis sister. They s0on arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been annovnced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd wos excessive—a drawing-room had not beeri held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in lhe smlle of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standirig in a corner by himself, heedlcss of all arourid him, engaged in the remembrance thclt the firsl tiine he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very plclce—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, al a little distonce, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his firftentry into society. He gazed tlll hjs limbs almost refusing to boar lheir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, clnd was driven home. He pclced lhe room with hurried steps, and fixed his handsvpon his head,as lf he were afrajd hiſ thoughts were bvrsling from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himself, he could not believo it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought hls imaginatiori hadconjured up the image his mind wasresting upon. It was impossihle lhat it could be real—he determined, therefore, t0 go again into socioty; for though he attemptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining insorination. He went a sew nights after with his sistcr to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the proteclion of a matron, he retired into o reccss, and there gave himself up to his own dcvavring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, thclt rnany were leavirig, he rovsed hjmself, clrid entering another room, found his sister surrounded 6y several, apparently in oomest converſation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when orie, whom he roquested to m0ve, turned round, and reveclled to him lhofofeatures he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sifter's arm, and, with hurried stcp, forced hor towards the street: at lhe door he found bimself impeded by the crowd os servants who werewaiting far their lords; and whilc he was engaged in possing them, he again heard that uoiee whisper close to him—\"Remember your ocltb!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister,soon reached home.\nAubrey becamo cllmost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by orie fubject, how inuch more complctely waf il engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sistcr's attentions were now unheeded, and lt was iri vain tbat she intreated him ta explajn ta her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a fow words, and t hose terrified hcr. Tho more he tbought, the mare he was bewildered. His oath startled bim;—was be lhen to allow lhis morister to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, amjdst all he held dear, and not averl its progress? His very sister might bave been touched by him. But even if bo were to break his oath, and diſclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He tbought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he reinembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only wbon his sister oame, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At lasl, no longer capable of bearlng stillnesf and solitu de, he left his h0use, roamed from street ta ftreet, clnxious to fly that image which hourited him. His dress became neglected, and hc wandered, cls often exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight damps. He was no longcr to be recognized; at first he returned wilh the everiing to the houfe; but at last he 1aid him down to rest whereuer fatjgue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow hjm; but tbey were soon distanced by bim who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his abfence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of wbose presence tbey were unconfclous, he determined to cnter again irito society, and watch him closely, anxiousto forewarn, in spite of hif oath, oll whom Lord Ruthven approached witb intirnacy. But wben he entered int0 a room, his haggard and suspicious looks woro so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, tbat his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seekjng, for ber sake, a society whlch affected him so strongly. Wben, howover, reinonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming allonated, they thovght it higb time to res urne agaln that trust which had been before irnposcd upori thein by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of sclving hlm froin thc injuries and sufferings he had daily cncountered in his wanderings, and of prevent ing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what thoyconsidcred folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take eonstant core of bim. He hardly appeored to notice it, so completely was his mlnd abs0rbed by one lerrible subject. His iricoherence became at last so great, that he was confjned to his chamber. Tbere he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaclated, his eyes had atlairied a glassy luflre;—the only sign of affection and recollccti0n remaining displayed itsclf upon the entry ofhif sister; then he would sometimes starl, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her riot totouch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Wbcn, however, shc inquired to wbom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! lrue!\" and agajn he sank into a state, whence n0t even she could rouse him. This lastod many months: gradually, howeuer, as the year was possjng, his incoherences became lefs frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whi1st hisguardians observed, that several llmes iri the day hc would c0unt upon his fingers a desinite number, arid then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsod, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his gvardiaris entering his ro0rn, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when bis sisler was going riext dcly to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad os tbis mark of returning inteIlect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they meritioned the name of the Eorl of Marsden. Thinking tbis was a yovng Earl whom he had met with in society, Au6rey seemed pIeascd, and clstonished them stjll more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered nol, but in a few minutes his sister waswith him. He was apparently agairi capable of being offected hy the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her lo his breast, and kissod her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more olive to the feelings of affection. He begon lo speak with allhis w0nted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriago with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster wbo had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm 0f rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon hor afking him why he thus destroyed the resembla-\nnce os ber future husband, he looked as is he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gclzing on her with a frantic expressiori of eounteriance, he bade her swear tbclt she would never wed this monsler, f0r he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if tbat voice again badehim remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no ane. In lhe meantirne the guardiclnf arid physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this wasbut a return of his djsorder, enlcred, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her ta leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of thcm ta dolay bul f0r one day. Thoy, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken posscssion of bis mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had c a11ed lhe morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. Wben he heard of Avbrey's ill health, he reodily underſtood himself to be the causo of it; but when he learned thclt he was deemed insane, his exultation and pIeasure could hardly be concealed srom those ainong wh0m he had gained this information. He hastenedto the house of bis former companion, and, by constant altendanco, and the pretence of great affection sar the brother and lnterest in his fate, he gradvally won the car of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangors and toils to recount—could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;—covld tcll bow, since he knew her, his existence, had beguri ta seem worlhy of presorvation, if itwere inerely thal he might listen to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of sate, that he gairied her affections. Thc tille of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an exouse for hastening themarriage, (in spite 0f her brother's deranged state,) which wos to take place the very day before his departure for the contirient.\nAuhrey, when he was left by the physician arid bis guardians, attempted to bribe tho servclnts, but iri vain. He askcd for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrotea lettor to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happ iness, her own honour, and the honour of those now inlhe grave, who once held her in their arms as thoir hope and the bope of their hovsc, to delay but for a sew hours that marriage, on w hich he denounced thc most heavy cursos. The seruantſ promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, ho thought il better not to harass ariy more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, whot he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may moro easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound os carriages hroke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost franlic. The curiosity of the servants at lastovercame their vigilance, they gradual1y stole awoy, leclving hiin in the custody of an helpless old womcln. He ſeized the opportunity, with one bound was out af tbe room, and ln a inoment found himself in tbe apartmenl where all werc noarly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hlm: he immediately opproclohed, arid, takirig his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless wlth rage. Wben on the staircase, L0rd Ruthvenwhispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dish0noured. Women are frail!\" So soying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by thc old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vont, had brokeri a blood-vessel, and he was eonve yed to bed. This was not mcntioned to his sister, wha was not prcfent when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. Tho marriage was solemnized, arid the bride and 6ridegroom lost London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of 6l0od produced symptoms of the near approach 0f deoth. He desired his sister's guardlans might be called, and wheri the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly whal the reader hcls perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MIT-\nYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world waſ all before bim, where to ehaase his place of rest, and Providerice his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, on board one of his Majosty's vesself, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of tbat name. The boauly of this place, and the ccrtairi supply of oattle and vegetobles always to be had there, induce many British vesselſ to visit it—both men 0f war and merchclritmen; arid though il lies rather out of the track for ships bovnd to Smyrna, its bounties amply rcpay for the deviation of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom 0f the boy, ond whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargoining for cattle with tbe natives, the clergy-\nman arid myselftook a rambleto the cave called Homer's School, and other places, whore we had heen before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small moriticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English Iord, wh0 left the iſlond sour dayſ preuious to our a rrivcll iri bif felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose ta quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He wcls an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over tbe hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he bas left an 0ld man in charge of it: he gave Domiriick, the wine-trader, ſix hvndred zoohinef for il, (about L250 English currency,) and has reſjded there about sourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucoa very 0ften to tbo different islands.\"\nThis aec0unt excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haftening to the house whcre our countryman had resided. We were kindly r eceivod by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments 0n the ground-floor—on cntrance hclll, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decor ated: plain green-stained walls, marble tabIes on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to plcly through the branches 6y moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronzc Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stoodhalf a dozen English cane choirs,and an empty book-case: there wore no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a lclrge mattress sproad on the floar, with two stuf-\nfed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room wc observod a mclrble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with baoks and papers, which were then in a large seamari's chest in the closet: il was open, but we did n0t think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, B0ileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the GermanIanguage; Klopstock's Mc ſsiah; Kotzebue's nouels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Coristantin0ple, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these boaks were filled wjth marginal notcs, wrltteri with a pencll, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was ljterally scribbled all ovor, and marked with slips of paper, on whicb also were remarks.\nThc old mari said: \"The lord bad been rcading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with tho 0thers; bvt,\" said he, \"there they must lie until hls retum; for he is so particular, that were I to move one tbing without 0rders, he would frawn upori me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the prodvoe of this farmf0r the trouble of taking care of it, except twentyzecbincs which I pay to an aged Armonian who resides in a small eottclge in tbe wood, and wbom the l0rd brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house cxternally was pleasing. Thc portico in front was fifty paces longand fourleen 6road, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths ond fret-work cornjces, (as it is n0w customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roos. The roof, surrounded 6y a Iight stone baluſtrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarfe linen. Most of the house-lops are thus furnished, af upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying theevening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small ftreamlet glided away, grapes, orangcs and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two largc myrtle busheſ, a marble soat with an ornamental woodenback was plclced, on wbich we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, roading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" faid tbc old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always clttended our church twice a week, be sides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye uiew.\" A line of rich vineyards led the oye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the fummit of wbich an ancicnt Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smoll streom issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades,until it was lost in the woods near the mountajn's base. The ſca srnooth as glass,and an h0rizon unshadowod by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little ori the left, throvgh a uista of lofty chcsnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, sludding thelight blue wave with spots of emorald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did thjs; but our enquirjes were fruitless as to the riame of the person who had resided in tbis romantic solilude: none kncw hls name but Domiriick, his banker, who bad g0ne to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" faid our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he wil1 nol,\"—\"And cannot you lell, old friend?\" sclid I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our retvrn lo the town we learnt ſeveral partioulars of the isolated lord. He had porlioned eighl young girls when be was last upon the islarid, arid everi dclnced with them at the nuplial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton arid silk to the girls who live by weavlng these artioles. He also bought a new hoat for a fisherman who had lost his awri in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamentsto the poor childreri. In short, he appeared lo us, from all we collected, to have bcen a very eccentrie ond benevolent character. One circumſtance we learnt, wbich our old friend at tbo cottage thought proper riot ta discloso. He had a most beautiful daughter, wlth whom the lord wcls often seen walking on tbe sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and tavght hor himself the use of it.\nSuch was the lnformation with which we dcparted from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who thif rambler in Greece covld be. He bad money it was evident: he had philanthropy of dispositlon, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrlved at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Fcllling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, cl pupjl af WYATT'S, who had bcen travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The jridividual,\" said he, \"about whom yov are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in iny travcls on the island of Tenedos, arid I also visitod him at Mityleno.\" We had neverthen heard of his lordshlp's faine, as we had been some years from home; but \"C hllde Harolde\" being put into our hands we recogriized the recluse of Calcla in overypage. Deeply did we regret not having becn more cu rious in our researches at the cattage, but we oonsoled ourselves wilh the ldea of returning to Mitylene on some futvre day; but to me that day will never retvrn. I make this statement, 6elieuing it not quite uniriteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, whioh has beeri grossly slandered. Ho has bocn descri6ed as af an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, ar contributing in ony way to sooth its sorrows, 0r add to its pleasures. The faet is directly the reuerse, as may be plainly gathered from these llttle aneedotes. All the fjner feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted iri his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bos0m. Tenderness, sympathy, arid charily appear to gujde all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reasari for inclrking him as a being on whose hoart Religion hath set her sea1, and over whose head Bencvolence hoth thrown her mantle. No man can readthe preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him aſ a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do nolassume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particvlarly whcn directed ogainst man's moral integrlty; and ho who dares jvſtify himself before that awful tribunal where all must clppear, alone may censure the errors af a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in fecret, and shvnthe wor1d's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "clean": "They soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which thiſ tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until oster the establishment of Chriftianity; and it has only assumcd its prcserit form since the divisjon of the Latin and Greek churches; at which tirne, the idea becoming prevalcnt, thclt a Lat in body could not corrupt if burjed in lheir territory, lt gradually increased, and sormed the subiect of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feedirig upori lhe blood of the young and beautifuI. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all ouer Hungary, Polan d, Auslrio, and Lorrajne, wbere tbc belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portiori of the b1ood of their victims, who became emaoiated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattencd—and their ueins became distendod to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of tbcir skinf.\nIn the Londori Journal, af March, 1732, is a curiovs, arid, of courfe, crediblo accovnt of a particular case of vampyrism, whicb is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngary. It appears, that upon ari examiriation af thc cornmonder-iri-chlef and magistrates of the place, they positively and vnariimously affirmed, that, abovt five years before, a certain Heyduke, nained Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, 0n the frontiers os the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, hut had found a way to rid himseIf of the evil, by eating some os tho earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This prccaution, however, did not preverit bim from hecoming a vampyre himself; for, about twonty or thirty days after his deoth and burial, many personscomp1ained of having been tormented by him, and cl depasitiori was mado, that four persans had been deprjved af life by his attacks. To prevent further mischjef, the inhabitants havirig consulted their Hadagni, took up tho body, and found lt (as is svppoſed to be usual iri cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entiroly free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid bIood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the aocustomcd remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and 6ody of Arnold Paul, at which ho is ropo-\nrted to havc cried oul as dreadfuIly as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned hls body, and threw the ashesinto hiſ grave. Tho same measures were adopted with the corses of those porſons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others wbo survived them.\nThe vniuersal belief is, thal a person sucked by a vampyre beoomes a varnpyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief bailiff.\nTbis monſtrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations thari any other instarice which could be adduced. In rnany partſ os Greece it is considered asa s0rt of punishmenl after dealh, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existenee, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, bul compelled to confirie his infernaI visitations ſolely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A fupposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut firft on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall srom its tomb be rent; Tben ghastly havnt the native place, And suck lhe bload of all thy race; There from thy daugbter, sist er, wife, At midnight drain lhe stream of life; Yet loothe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yel expiro,Shall kri0w thc deman for their sire; As cursing t hee, thou cursing them, Tby flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The yovngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a fatber's name— Thclt ward sball wrap tby heclrt in flame! Yet thou must end tby task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glaſsy glancc must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless 6lue; Thcn with unhall0wed hand shall tear Tbe tressef of her ycl1ow hair, Of which, in life a lock whcn shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Meinorial of thine agony! Yot with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullcn grave, Go—and with Gouls ond Afrits rave, Till thcso in h0rror shrink away From spectre more occvrsed than they.\nMr. Southey has olso introduced in his wild but beavtiful poem of \"Tbalaba,\" the vclmpyre corse ofthe Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned frorn the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in oxislence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted sram the sinfulnoss of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as o complete type of purity and inriocence. Thc veraciaus Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of ſeveral astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to havc been an eyewitnesſ; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject,bosides a variety of anocdotes, and traditionary riarrotives jllustrative os its effects, has pvt f0rth some learned dissertcltions, ten-\nding to prove it t0 6e a classical, af well as barbarian orror.\nMany curious and interesting notiees on this singularly horrible superstition rnight be added; tbough the present may suffice for the limits 0f a notc, necessarily dev0ted to oxplanation, and which may now bc c0nc1uded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one jnm0st general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brouc0loka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeried lhat in tbe midst of tbe dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the Ieaders of the ton a noblemari, more remarkable for hif singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as is he could not participale tberein. Apparently,the light lavghter of the foir only atlracted his attention, that he might by a loak qucll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessnoss reigned. Those wbo folt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed il to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did n0t sccm to penctrate, and at one glance ta pierce through to the inward workings of the beart; bvt fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that wejghed upon tbe skiri it eould not pass. His pecuIiarities caused bim to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fclt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presenoe capable of engaging their attenti0n. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the str0ng emolion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, mariy of the femalo hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some rnorks of what lhey might term affectjon: LadyMercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since ber marriage, threw herself in his way, and did oll 6ut put on lhe dress of a mountebank, to attract his natice:—though in vain:—when sbe stood before him, though his eyes were apparent1y fixed upon her's, still it seemed aſ if they were unporceived;—even her unappaIled impudence was bclfsled, arid ſhe left the field. But though the common adultress could not influericc even the guidance of his oyes, it waf not that the femole sex was iridifforent to hiin: yet such was the apparent caulion wilh which he ſpoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himsolf to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it waf that it even overcame the dread of his singulclr character, or that they were inoved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domcstic virtues, as among those who sully it by lheir vices.\nAboul lhe same time, thcre came to London a young gentleman of tbe nclme of Aubrey: he wos an orphan lest with an only sister in the possession of great weallh, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortvne, while they reljnquished the more importanl charge of his mind ta tbe care of rnercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, bence, that high romantie feeling of honour and oaridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He be1ieved all to sympathise with virlue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesquo effect of thc scerie, as we see in romances: he thought that tho misery of o cottage merely consisted iri the vesting of clothes, wbich were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye hy lheir irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in f ine, that the droams af poets were lhe realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rieb: for these reasons, upan his entering inta the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should d escribe with Ieast trulh their languishing or romp ing favourites: tho daugbters at the same lime, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his ljps, soon led bim into false notions of bis talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his soIilary hours, he was startledat finding, that, except in the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was na foundation jn real life for any of that congeries os pleasing picturcs and deseriptions oontained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, howeuer, some compensatian in his gratified vanity, he was about to rclinquish bis dreams, when the extraordiriary being we have above described, crossed him in hlſ career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of formlng an idea os the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observati0n af external objects, thari the tacit afsent to their existcrice, jmplied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing bis imaginatiori to pictureevery thirig that flattered its propensity ta extravagant ideas, he soon forined this object into the hero of a romance, and determlned to observe the offfpring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted witb him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon biſ notice, that his preseriee was always recagnised. He gradually Iearnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soari found, from the notes of preparation ln — Street, lhal he was about totravel. Deſirous of gaining some information respecting this sirigular charaeter, who, till now, bad only wh ettod his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was timc for him to perform the tour, which for many generations hcls been thought necessary to enable tbe young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upori an equality with the aged, and notallowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scanda1ous iritrigues are mentioncd as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They c0nsented: and Aubrey immedialely mentioriing hiſ intentions lo Lord Rulhuen, was surprised ta receiue from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by sucb a mark of esteem from hjm, who, apparently, hcld nothing jn common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opporlunily of studying Lord Ruthven'scharacter, and now he found, that, though many rnore of his actions were exposed tohis view, the resuIts osfered different conclusians from the apparent motjves t0 hjs conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and tho beggar, received srom his handmore than onough to relieve their jmmediate wants. But Aubrey could nol avoid remarklng, that it was not upon the virtuous, roduced to indigence by the misfortunes atteridant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were fent from lhc daor with hardly suppressed sneers; but wben the profligate came to ask something, not to relievo his wants, 6ut to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to ſink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent clway with rich charity. This was, however, otlributed by him to tbe greater lmportunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over tbe retiring bashfulncsf of the virtuous indigent. There was orie circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was still rnore impressed upon his mind: clll those upon wham il was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, far tbey wore all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the moft a6ject inisery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey waf surprized at the apparent cagerness with which his companion sovght for tho centres of all fashionoble vice; there heentered into all the spirit of the faro lable: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known shclrper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but jt was always with the sarne unchanging face, with whicb he generally watchcd the sociely around: it was not, however, s0 wheri he encountcred the rash youthful novjce, or the luckless father os a nuinerous fclmily; thon his very wish seemed fortune'f law—this apparent abstractedness of mind waſ laid aslde, and his eycs sparkled with more fire than that of the cat wbilst daIlying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the f ormerly affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the soIitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him witbin the reach of tbis fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immenſe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their presont craving. Yet he took no money from lhe gombling table; but imrnediately lost, to tbe ruiner of many, the lastgilder he had just snatched frorn the convulsjve grasp of the inriocent: lhis might but bc the result af acertain degree of knowledge, which wclf riot, however, capable as combating the cunnlng of lhe more oxperienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and bcg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend la his own profit;—hut he delayed it—for each doy he boped his friend would give hjm some opportunity of speakirig frankly and openly to bim; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in bis carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; ond though Aubrey was near the objoct of his curiosity, he obtalned no greater gratjfication from it than the c0nstant excitement of vainly wifhirig to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of fomothing supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, aridAubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upori the morning eircle of an Itcllion countess, whilst he went in search of the memorjals af another almost doserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from Englclnd, whjch he opened with eager impationce; tbe fi rst was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; tbe others were from his guardiaris, tbe latter astanished him; if it had before entered inta bis imagination that there was an evil power resident in his compclnion, these seemed to give bim suffieient reason sor the belief. His guardians irisisted upon his immediately lcavlng his friend, arid urged, that his charactor was dreadfully viciouf, for that the possession of irresistib1e powerf of seduction, rendered his licenlious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that hif contempt for the adultreſs had not originated in batred of her character; 6ut tbat he had required, to enbanoe hif gratifioation, that his victim, the partner of hls guilt, should be hurled from lhe pinnacle os unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sine, that all those semales whom he had ſought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since bis departure, throwri evcn the mask asidc, arid had not scrupled to exposo the whole doformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leauing one, whose eharacter hod n0t yet shown a slrigle brighl point on whioh to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plclusible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to walch him more closely, and to lel no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He cntered into the sarne circle, and soon perceived, thot his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose housc he ehiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimclrried female is met with in society; he was thereforo obliged ta carry on his p1ans in secrel; but Aubrey's eye followed him jn all his windings, and soon discovered that an afſignation had been oppointed, which would mosl likely end in the ruin of cln innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intcntions with respect to the lady, informing him atthe same time that he was aware of hif being ahoul to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he suppofed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether be intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avbrey retlred; and, immediately wriling a note, to say, that from that moment he must decljne accomponying hif Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordored bis fervant to seek other apartments, and calIing upon the inother of the lcldy, informed her os all he knew, not only with regard t0 her daughter, but a1so concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation wcls prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete afsenl to a separation; but did nol hint any suspieion of his plans having been foiled byAubrey's interpositiori.\nHaving lest Rome, Aubrcy directed his steps towardſ Greece, and crosslng the Peninsula, soon found himseIf at Athens. He then fixed hif residence in the house of a Greek; clnd foon oecupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancienl glory upon manuments that apparently, aſhamed of chronicling the deeds of freemeri only besore slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as bimself, existed a being, so beautlful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtrcly on canvass the promised hope of the failhful in Mahomet'ſ paradisc, save lhat hor eyes spoke too much mind forany one to thjnk she could belong to lhose who had rio souls. As she danced upon the p1ain, or tripped alo ng the mountain's sidc,one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof her beouties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the clnimal suitcd 6ut to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acooinpanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconseious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whoIe beauty of hcr form, floating as it wcre upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, wbo forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almosl effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flittod around, exhibit in the ſun's ray sueh delicately briIliarit and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse lhe forgetsulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object ho had before thought of vital importance to lhe proper interpretalion of a passoge in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can apprcciate?—It was inriocence, yauth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those romains of which he wished lo preserve a memorial for hls future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencjl, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would lhen describe to him the circling dclnce vpon the open plain, would painl, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greatcr impression upon her mind, would tell him all the sup ernatural tales os her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent beliefaf what she narrated, excited lhe inlerest euen of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyro, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest tief, forced every year, by feeding upon the life os a lovely female to prolong hjs existenco for the erisuing months, his blood would run coId, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idlc and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last dctected one living among lhemfelves, after several of their neclr relatives and childreri had been found marked with the starnp of the siend's appetitc; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to beljeve her, for jt had been, romarked, that those who hcld dared to question their exislence, always had same proof given, which ab1iged thom, with griefand heartbreakjng, lo confess it was true. Shc detailed to him the traditional appear-\nance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurale description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, thal there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in lhe supernatura1power os Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey began to atlach himself more and moro to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtves of the women among whom he had s0vght for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridicu1ed the idea of a young inanof English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more altached to the almosl fairy form before him. He would tear himself at timesfram her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object waſ attained; but he alwoys found jt impossible lo fjx his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mirid he retained cln image that seemod alone tbe rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uriconscious os hls love, and was ever the same frank infanti1e being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was beoause she hod rio longer any one wilh whom she could visit her favourlte haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncoveririg some fragmorit wbich hod yet escclped thc destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subjcct os Vampyref, and they b0tb, with severaI present, affirmed their existence, pclle with borror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey dotermined to proceed upon one 0f his excursions, whieh was to detain him for a few h0urs; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, os he must necessarily pclss through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, afler thc dcly had closed, upon any consideration. They describod lt as the resort of thevampyres iri their nocturnal orgios, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon hlm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representati0ns, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw tbem fhudder at his daring thus to mock a svperior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made tbeir blood freeze, he was silenl.\nNext mornlrig Aubrey set off upon his excurfion unattended; be was surprised to observe thomelancholy face of his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, bad inspired them with sucb terrar. Wben he was about to depart, Ionthe carne to the side of hls horse, andearnestly begged os him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings lo be put in acti0n;—hc promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that iri the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, clnd pour all thoir rage upon the devoted country.—Hc at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by spced for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, ln these southern climates, is alm0st unknown; immediately the sun sels, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing lhunders had scclrcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rairi forced its way through the canopying foli ogc, whilst the blue forkcd lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his uery feet. Suddenly hiſ horse took fright, and he was carried wjlh dreadfvl rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he fovnd, by the glareof lightning, that he was in the neighbovrhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted ilself up from tbe masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approclched, hoping to find some one to gvide him to the town, or at least trvsting to obtain shelter from the pelting os the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a moment silent, all0wed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stjfled, exultant mockery of a laug h, continued in ane almost unbroken sound;—ho was slartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rollod over his head, he, wilh a sudden efforl, forced open the door 0s the hut. He fovnd himself in vtter darkness: the sound, bowever, guided hjm. He was apparently unperceived; for, though hc ealled, stiIl the founds continued, and no notice wos taken af him. He f ound himself in contact wilb some one, whom he immediately seizcd; when a voice cried, \" Agclin bafflod!\" to which o loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by 0ne whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell bis life as dearly cls he could, he struggled; but it was ln voin: he was lifted from his feet clnd hurled with enormous force againsl the graund:—his enomy threw himself upon him, ond knecling vpon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the bole that gavc ljght in the day, dislurbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, clnd in a moment the crashing of the hranches, as he broke through the woad, was no longer beard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapahle of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the ljght af theirtorches fell upon thc mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy f1akes of soal. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her crjes; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torchef once more burst upon hjm, to perceive the airy form os his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hop ing that jt was but a vision arising fromhiſ disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he uncl0sed thcm, stretehed by his sjde. There was no colour upon her cheek, n0t even vpon her lip; yet tberc was a stillness obout her face that seemed almo st as attclcbing as tho life that orice dwelt there:—upon her neck and brcast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teoth hauing opened the vein:—to this tbe men pointed, crylng, simultaneoufIy slruck with horror, \"AVampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who bad lotely been to him the object of so many hright and fairy visionſ, now fallen with thc flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thovghtſ were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to sbun reflection, and lake refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular oonstructiori, which had been found in the hut. They were soon mct by difserent parties who had been engaged in the searoh ofher whom a mother had mlssed. Their lamentable cries, as they appr0achod the city, forewamed the parents of some dreodful catastrophe. —To describe their gries would be impossible; bvt when thoy oscertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, arid point ed lo the corse. They were inc0nsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized wilh a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these interva1s he would ca1l upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccounta6le coinbination he seemed to beg of his former companion to sparo the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upori his head, and cursc him as her destroyer. Lord R uthven, chanced at this time t0 arrivo al Athens, and, from whatover motive, upori hearing of the statc of Aubrey, immediately placed himse1f in the same house, and became bjs constont attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he wos horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image ho had now combined with that of o Vampyre; but Lord Rulhven, by his kind words, implying almofl repentance for lhe fault thal hadcaused their separation, and still more by the atte ntion, onxiety, and care whjch ho showed, foon reconciled himto his presence. His lordship seemed quito changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; butas faon as his convalescence began tobe rapid, he again grcldually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceivcd no difforence from the former man, except that at times be was svrpriſed to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, wilh a smile of ma1icious exultation pIoying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the Iast stage of the invaIid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wclues raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, tbe moveless sun;—indeed, be appeared t0 wish to avoid lhe oyes of a1l.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, wcls much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whieh had once so dislingujshod him now seemed to have fled f0r ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wishcd for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbaurhood of Athens; if he sovght it omidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Iantho's form stood hy bis sjde—lf he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the mod est vjolet; then suddenly turning raund, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smi1e upon her lips. Ho determined to fly sceries, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven,to whom he held himsclf bourid by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those ports of Grecce rieither hadyet seen. They trovelled in every direction, and sought every spot to whicb a reco1lection could beattached: bvt thougb they thuſ hasteried from place to place, yet they seeined not to heed what they gazed upon. Tbcy heard much of robberf, but they gradually began t0 slight these reports, which they imagjned wero onIy the invention os individuals, whose interest it wcls to excite the generosity of those whom they defended froin preten ded dangers. In consequence of thus ncglecting thccldvico of the inhabitants, on one occosiori they traveIled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon enteririg, however, a narrow defilo, at lhe bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their nogligence; for scarcely were the whole of the parly engaged in the narrow pass, when tbey were slartled hy the whjstling of bullets close to their heodſ, and by thoecboed report of several gunf. In an instant their guardſ had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in tbo direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of heing thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts bade thern advance, and belng expased to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take thom in the rear, they determined at once to rvshforward in seareh of the eriemy. Hardly had they l0ft the sheller of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which braught him to the ground. Aubrey hastenod t0 bis assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces araund him—hiſ guards havin g, upon Lord Ruthveri's being wounded, immediately thrown up thoir arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Auhrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upori o ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—th ey being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with thc promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strengtb rapidly decreased; in two dclys mortlfication onsued, and death seemed advancing wjth hasly steps. His eonduct and appearance had not ehanged; he seemed as uneonscious of painas he had been os the objects about him: 6ul towards the close of the laſt cvening, his mind became apparently unoafy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was indvced to offor his assistance with more lhan usual eamestness—\"Assist ine! you may save me—you may do more than thal—I mean not my life, I heed the death af my existence as little af that of the passing day; but you may save my hono-\nur, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? te1l me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I necd but 1ittle—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—bvt is yov would conceal all you know 0f me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shal1 not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your natvre fears, swear that, for o year and a day you will not impart your knowledgo of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you maysee. \"—Hls eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAvbrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many ciroumstanees clttending his clcquaintance with this mori rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from lhe preſentiment of somelhing horrib1e awaiting him. Rjsing early iri lhe morning, he was about to onter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met hiin, and informed him that il was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself arid comrodes, upon bis retiring, to the pinnocle os a rieighbouring mount, according to a proinise they had given his lordship, that il should be exposed to the firsl cold ray of the m0on thclt rose after his death. Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several of the men, determincd lo go and bury it upon the spotwhere jt lay. But, when he had rnounted l0 the summit he f0und no troce of eitber the corpse or the clotheſ, lhough the robbers swore they pointcd 0ut the jdentical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in corijectures, bvt he at last retvrried, convinced that thoy had buried the oorpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of o country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently corispired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had selzod upon his mind, he resoIved to leave il, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel lo convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing seueral weapons of offonce, more or less cldapted to ensure the death of tho victim. There were scveral daggers and ataghons. Whilst turning tbem over, ond examining lheir curious forins, whot was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weap on, ond his horror rnay be imagined wben he discovered thal it fitted, though pecu1iarly shaped, the sheath he heId in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no furlher certainty—they seemed gazing to 6e bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; hul the particular form, the same varying tinls upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there werealso drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were cancerning lhe lady he had attemptod to ſnatch from Lord Ruthven's seductjve arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deparlure os his lordship. Aubrey's mirid became olmost broken under so inariy ropeated horrorf; he was afraid lhat tbis lady had sal1en a viclim lo the deftroyer of Ianthe. He becaine morase and filent; clnd hiſ only occupation cansisted in urging the speed of the postilions, af if hewere going to save the 1ife of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a bree2e, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him ta the English shores; and he haslened to tbe mansion as hjs fathers, and ther o, for a mament, appeared to losc, in the embraces and caresſes of his sister, all memory of the past. If sbe besore, by her infantine caresses, had goiried his offection, naw that the wornan began to appear, sbe was still more attachjng as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains lhe gaze and applaufe 0f the drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy whichonly exists in the heated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her b1ue eye was never Iit up by the levity of the mind bcrieath. There was a melancho1y charm abovt it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling wjthin, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her step waſ not that light footing, which stroys where'er a butterfly or a coIour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alarie, her face waf never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her bis affection, and would in her presence forget lhofe gri efs she know destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged hcr smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if thofe eyeſ,—that faoe were then playing in the light of the ir own natiue sphere. She waſ yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it hauing been thought by ber guardians more fit that her presentation sh ould be delayed until her brother's return from the conlinent, when he might be her pratector. It was now, lherefore, resolved thatthc nexl drawing-room, which was fast approachlng, should be the epoch of her enlry into the \"busy scene.\" Au hrcy would rather have remained in the inansjon of his fathers, and fed vpon tbe inelancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strclngers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had wjtnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own cornfort to the protectiori of his sister. They so0n arrived in town, and prepared for tho next day, which had been onnounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—cl drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxj0us to bask in tbe smile of royalty, hastened thithcr. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whlle he was standing jn a corner by himseIf, heedless of clll around him, engoged in the remembrance that the first tirne he had seen Lord Ruthvon was in that very plaoe—he selt bimself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in hls ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly oourage ta turn, fearful of ſeeing cl speotre thclt would blclst him, when he perceivcd, at a liltle distanco, the same flgure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing lo bear their weight, be was obljged to take the arm of a friend, and forclng a passage throvgh the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and waſ driven home. He paced thc room with hurried steps, and fixcd hisharids vpon his head,af if he were afraid his thoughts were burstlng frorn his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumftances started up in drecldful array—the dagger—his oath.—He rousod himself, he could not believe it possible—the decld rise again!—He thaught hisimagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It wcls irnpossible that it could be real—he determined, theresore, to ga agoln into society; for though be allempted to ask concernirig Lord Ruthven, the name hung up0n his lips, and he could not ſucceed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with hls sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection af a matran, he retired into a recess, and there gave himsclf up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, fovnd his sister surrounded hy several, apparentIy in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, tvrned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, feized his sifter's arm, and, with hurried ſtep, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himsels impeded by thecrowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that v oice whisper closc to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached horne.\nAubrey became alm0st distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now lhat the ccrtainty of lhe monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sisler's attentions were now vnheeded, and it was in vain that she intrealed him to explain to her wbat had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath slartled him;—was be then to allow this morister to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, arid not avert its progress? His very sister might haue becn touched by hiin. But even if he were to break his oath, and disolose his ſvspicions, who would believe him? He thaught of employirig his own hand to free the world from such o wrctch; but deoth, he remembered, had been already mocked. For dayſ he remained in this state; shul up in his room, he saw noone, and ale only when his sister cclme, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support riature. At last, no longeroapable of bearing slillneſs and solitudo, he left his house, roamed from street to street, clnxious to fly that image whlch haunted hiin. His dress became negleoted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day suri as to lhe midnight damps. He was no longer lo be recognized; atfirst he returned with theevening to the house; but at 1ast he laid him dowri to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His slster, anxiovs for his safety, employed people to f0llow him; but they were soon djstanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His oonduct, howeuer, sudderily changed. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his sricnds, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enler again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forcwarn, in spjte of hjs oath, all whom Lord Ruthvon approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspiciouf looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obligcd to beg of him to abstain from sccking, for hcr sake, a soeiety which aff-\nected him so ſtrongIy. When, however, remonslrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper ta lriterpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, thoy thought it high time lo resume a gain thot trust which had been hefore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous 0f saving him from the injurieſ ond sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing t0 tho general eye those marks of what they considcred folly, they engaged a physicicln to refide in the house, and take constarit care of him. Ho hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed byone terrihIe subject. His incoherence became ot last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, ineapable of 6ejng roused. Hc had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affectjon and recollectlon remaining displayed itsclf upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks thot severe lyaffllcted her, ho would deslre her not to touch hirn. \"Ob, do not louch him—if your love for me is clugbt, do not go riear bim!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, hiſ only answer was, \"True! lrue!\" and again he sank into a state, whenco not even she cauld rouse him. Thls lasted many months: gradually, howcver, as tho year was passing, his iricoherences bocame less frequent, and his mind thrcw aff a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians o6scrved, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of bis guardians entering his room, began to converse with his p hysioian upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's bei ng in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Auhrey's altention was attracted; he asked anxiavsly to whom. Glod of this mark of returning intellect, of which thoy feared he had been deprived, tbey meritioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pIeased, and astonished tbem ftll1 more by hisexpressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring t0 see his sister. They anfwered nat, but in a few minuleſ his sjster was with him. Hc was apparent ly agoin capable of being affected by the lnsluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed ber cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thaugbt of her brother's being ance more alive to the feelings of affeetion. He began lo speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratu1clte her upon her marriage with a person so distinguishcd for rank and every accomplishmcnt; when he suddenly pcrceived a l0cket upon her breasl; openjng il, what was bis surprise at boholding the features of the monster who had so lang influenced his life. He seized lhe portrait in a paroxysm of rage, arid trampled it vnder foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her futurc husband, be l0oked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantie expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would riever wed thif monstcr, for he— But be cauld not cldvance—it scemed aſ is thot voioe again bade him remembor his oath—he turned suddenly round, thiriking Lord Ruthven was near him but sclw no ane. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who hod heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and for-\ncing him from Miss Aubrey, defired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he imp1ored, he hegged of tbem to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeav0ured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been resused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily undcrstood himself to bethe cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemod insclne, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the houſe of his former companion, ond, by constant attendanoe, and lhc prctence os great affection for the br other and interest in hiſ fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Wha could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tollf to recount—could speak af himself as of an individual having rio syinpathy with any bcing on the crowded earth, save with hor to whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existenoe, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing aocents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use lhe serpenl's art, or such was lhe will of fate, that he gained her affectioris. The title of the elder branch falling at length to hjm, he obtained an irnportant ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening lhe mclrriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged statc,) which wos to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the phyfician and his guardians, attempted to brihc thc servants, but in vajn. Ho asked for pen and paper; it was glven him; he wrote a letter t0 his siſter, conjuring her, as sbe valued her own happinesſ, hcr own honour, and the honour of thosc now jn lhe grave, who once held her in lheir arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but f0r a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the moſt heclvy curses.The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, tho ravingf of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy irimates of the hause; and Aubrey heard, wilh a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the n0tes of 6usy preparation.Morning camo, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servanls clt last overcame their vigilanoe, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He ſeized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment sound himself in the apartment where all werc nearly assemb1ed. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hirn: he immediately approacbed, and,taking his arm by force, hurri ed him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Rutbven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if n0t my 6ride to day, yovr sister is dishonoured. Womori are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendarits, who, r oused by the old woman, had come in ſearch of him. Aubrey could no longer support hlmself; his roge nat finding vent, had broken a blood-vefsel, and he waſ conveyed to bed. This wos not mentioned to his ſister, wha wcls not present when he entered, as the physician was afrald of agitatirig her. The marriage wos so1emnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakncss increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approaoh of death. He desirod his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused—he died iinmediately after.\nThe gvardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wben thoy arrived, it was too late. Lord Rvlhven had disappeared, andAubrey's ſister had glutted the thirft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF L0RD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Theworld wos all bef0re him, where to cho0se hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, an board one of his Majesly's vessels, in the year 18I2, we pul into the har6our of Mitylenc, in tho island af that name. The beauly of this place, and the certairi supply of cattlo and vegetables alwayf to be had there, induce many British vessels to vlsit it—bolh men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track f0r ships bound t0 Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for tho deviation os a voyage. We landed; af usval, at lhebottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in w atering, and the purscr bargaining for cattle wlth the natives, the clergyman arid myself tooka ramble lo tho cave called Homer's School, and other placeſ, where we had been befaro. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engageda young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come frain Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days provious to our arriva1 in his felucoa. \"He erigaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have token me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely lo get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The c0ttage over the hill, facing the river, bclongf to bim, and he has left an old man in charge 0f it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechiries sor it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constclntly; for he sails in his feluoca very often to the different islarids.\"\nThis account excited our euriasity very much, andwe lost no time in hastening to lhe house where our covntryman had r esided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over themclnsion. It c0nsisted of four apartmentf on the ground-floor—an entronce hall, a drowing-room, a ſitting parlaur, and a bed-room, with a spacious cloſet annexed. They were allsimply decorated: pl ain groen-stained walls, marble tclbles on eitherside, a lorge myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made ta play through the branchcs by rnovirig a spririg fixed ln the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed lhe furniture. In the hall stood half a doz eri English cane chairs, and an empty baok-case: there were no mirrors, nor a sing1e pointing. The bedchamber had morely a large mattress spread on tbe floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed o marble reeess, formerly, the 0ld man told us, filled with books and papers,whlch were then in a large soaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did riot thirik ourselves justified in examinirig the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Ro ufseau's works complete; Volney's Rvinsof Einpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of thc Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editiori, prinled at Parma in I810; severa1 small pamphlets fram the Grcek press at Constantinop1e, much torn, but no English book 0f any description. Most of theso books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe 0ld man said: \"The lord had been reading these books tbe evening before he sailed, and forgot to place thom with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie unti1 his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing withovt orders, he would frowri upon me for a week together; he is otherwoys very go0d. I once did him a fervice; and I have the prodvce os this farm for the troubIc of laking care of it, except twenty zecbines wbich I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small oo ttclge in the wood, and whom lhe lord brougbt here from Adrianople; I don't know for wbat reason.\"\nTbe appearance of tbe house exlernally was pleasing. The portico in front was fisty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marblc pillars with black pliriths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now eustomary iri Grocian architecture,) wcre considerably hlgher than the roof. The ro0f, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covercd 6y a sine Turkey carpot, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of thc house-tops are thus furnishcd, as up0n them the Greeks pass thcir evenings in smoking, drinkirig light wines, such af \"lachryrna christ i,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small strcamlet glided away, g rapes, 0ranges and limef were cluftering together on itſ borders, and under the shade of two large myrlle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamerita1 wooden back was placed, an which we were told, the lord passed mony af his evenings arid n ights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and taIking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was uery dcvovt, \"and always attended our ehurch twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"o bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to MovntCalcla, covered wjth oliue and myrtle treeſ in bloom, and ori the svmmit of which an ancient Greek templeappeared iri majestic decay. A small streomissuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woads near the mau-\nritain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninates the vicw in front; and a little on the left, through a ujsto of 1ofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small iflands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wavo with spots os emerald groen. I seldom enjoyed a view morc than I did tbis; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his riame but Dominick, hjs banker, who had g0neto Ca ndia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, hut I am sure be will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, 6ut on our return lo the lown we learnt several particulars of theisolated lord. He had portioried eight young girls when hc was lasl upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptiol feasl. He gave a oow to one man, b orfeſ to others, and cotton and silk to the girls wha live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishermari wbo had lost bis own iri a gale, and he oftcn gave Greek Testaments to the poor cbildren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have beeri a very eccentric and benevolcntcharacter. One circumstance we learnl, which our old friend at the cottage thaught proper not to disclose. He had a most bcautifvI daughter, with whorn the lord was often seen walkirig on the sea-shore, and he had bought hcr a piano-forte, and taught her himself the usc of it.\nSvch was the jnformation with whlch we departed from the peaceful is1e os Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guefſing who this rambler in Greeoe could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanlhropy of disposition, arid all those eocentricitjes whjch mark p eculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were di spel1ed. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architeet, a pupil of WYATT'S,who had been trovelling in Egypt andGreoce, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byran; I rnet bim in rny travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of hjs lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognlzed the recluse of Calc1a in euery page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at lhe cottag c, 6ut we consoled ourſelves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future dcly; but to mo lhat day will rievcr return. I mclke this statement, believing it ri0t quite uninteresting, andin justice to his lordship's goad name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to ossociating with human nalure, ar contributing in ariy way to footh ils sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly tbe reverse, as may be plairily gathered from these little anecdoles. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegontly dep icted in his lordship's pooms, secm to have their seat in hjs bosom. Tenderriess, sympatby, and charity appear lo guide aIl his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an odditional reason for marking him as a being on whose beart Religion hath set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence halh thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"lrails\" without feeling proud of him aſ a countryman. With respect to his Ioves or pleasvros, I do not assume a right to giue an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed againsl man'smoral integrity; and he who dares justisy himself besore that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censurc the errors of a follow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of hisgenius. To do good in secret, and shun the wor1d's applause, js the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving canscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prlnter, Crown-caurt, Fleet-street.",
    "clean": "Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition vpon which this tale is founded is very general in the Eclst. Among tbe Arabians it appears lobe common: it did not, however, exterid itself to the Grecks unti1 after the esta6lishinent of Cbristianity; and it has only assumed its present form fince the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if burjod in their territory, it graduaIly increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beavtifvl. In the West it spreod, with some slight variation, all over Hungory, Polarid, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the 6elief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibcd a cert-\naln portion of tbe blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of eorisumplions; whilst these human blood-svckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletiori, as to causo the blood to flow srom all the passages of thejr bodics, and evori from the very poref of lhcir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible aocount ofa particular oase of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngary. It appcars, that upon an examination of the commander-in-ohief and rna gistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years besor e, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pavl, had beeri heord to say, that, at Caſsovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he hod been tormented by a vainpyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the eorth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbjng himself withhis blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days clfter his death and 6urial, many persons cornplained of having been tormented by hirn, and a deposition was made, tbat four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisrn) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, thcy resorted to the aecuflomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which ho is reportod to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This d0ne, thoy cut off bis head, bvrned his body, and lhrow tbe ashes into his grave. The sclme measures were adopted with the corses of tbose persons who had previously died from vampyrism, 1est thoy should, in their turn, become agents upon olhers wha survived thcm.\nThe universal belief is, tbat a person suckod by a vampyre bccornes a vampyre hirnsclf, and sucks in his turn.\nChief baillff.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is here related, because il seems betler adapted to illustrate thc subjecl of the prosent observations than any other inftanee which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aster death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in exiſtence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but coinpelled to confine his infernal visitations solely ta those beings he loved mosl while up0n earth—th0se to wham he was bourid by ties of kindred and affoction.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earlh, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse fhaIl from itſ lomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midriighl draln the stream of Iife; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Tby victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; Aſ cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withcred on the stem. But onc thot forthy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloued of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap tby heart in slame! Yot thou musl end thy task and mark Her cheok's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must vlew Which freezes o'er ils lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in ljfe o lock when shorn Affection's fondost pledge was worn— But riow is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood fhall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard 1ip; Then stalklng lo thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre mare accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced iri his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse 0f the Arabion maid Oneiza, who is rcpresented aſ having rcturried from the grave for the purpose of tormenling him she best loved whilst in existence. But thif cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her Iife, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity clnd innocence. Tbe veraciaus Toumefort gives a long occount in his travels os several astonishjng cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calrnet, in his great work upon thissubject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradjtionary riarrativcs illustrative of its effects, hos put fortb some learned dissertations, tendlng to prave it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this sjnguIarly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for tbe limils of a note, riecessorily devoted lo explanation, and which may now be coneluded by mere1y remarking, that tbough the term Vampyre iſ the one in most gerieral acceptation, there are several others synonymous wjth it, mclde use of in variaus parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant vpon a Londori winter, thereappeared at the vclrious parljes of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his sjngvlarities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of thc fair only attrclcted his attentiori, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts wherc tboughtlessness rcjgncd. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explaln whence it arose: some attributod it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the 0bject's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through ta tho inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray tbat weighed upon the skin il could not pass. His pecu1jarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see hiin, and those who bad beeri clecustomed to vioIerit excitement, and riow fclt the weight of ennui, were pleased at hauing something in their presencecapable of engaging their attention. In spite af the de adly hue of his sace, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty,or from thestrong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beauljful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attompted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term afsection: Lady Mercer, who hcld been tho mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-raoms sirice her mclrriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but pvt on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she ftood before him, though hiſ eyes were opparently fixed upon her's, still it s eemed as if thoy were unperceived;—evcn ber uriclppalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the comrnori adultress could not influence everi the guidance of his eyes, it was not tbat the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that fcw knew he euer addressed hjmself to feinales. He had, howeuer, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether il was that it even overcame the dread of bis flrigular c haracter, or that they were moved by his clpparent hatrod of vice, he was as often omong those females who form the boaſt of their fex from theirdomestic virtues, as among thofe who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same tlme, thore came to London a young gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: he was an orph an left with an only sister in the possesfiori os great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more lmportant charge of his mind to the care of mercenary suba1ternf, he cultiuated more his imogiriation than his judgment. He had, hence, that high ramontic feeling of honour and candour, whioh daily ruins so many mjl1iners' appreritices. He bclieved all to sympathise with virtue, and thought lhat vice was thrown in by Providencc merely for lhe picturesque effecl os the scene, as we see in romancos: he thought that the misery 0s a cottage merely consisted in the ve sting of clothes, which were af warm, but which were better adaptod to the painter's eye by thejr irrogular folds ond various coloured patches. He tbought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the rea1ities of life. He was handsome, fronk, and rich: forthese reasons, upori his entering into the gay clrcles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describc with least truth their languishing or rompirig favourites: tho daugbters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whon he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talenls and hjs me rit. Attclched as he wos to the rornance of his folitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tcl1low and wax candles that flickered, not from the presencc of o ghost, but from want of snufflng, therc was no fovndation jn real life for any os that congerics of pleasing pictures and descriptions containod in thosc volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, same compcnsation in his gratisied vanjty, hc was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extra0rdjnarybeing we have abovo described,crossed him in hls cclreer.\nHe wcltched him; clrid the very impossibility 0f f0rming an idea of thc c haracler of a mon entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacjt assent to their existence, imp-\nlied by the ovoidance of their conlact: allowing his imaginotiori to picture overy lhirig that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formcd this objoct into the hero of a romance, and delermiried to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainled with him, paid him attentioris, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He graducllly learnt that Lord Ruthveri's asfairs were embarrclssed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about lo travel. Desirous of gajning some information respecting this singular chclracter, who, li1l now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, whicb far many generations has been thovght nccessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praiſe, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consentcd: and Aubrey immcdiateIy mcntioning his intentions to Lord Rvthven, was surprlsed to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such o mark os esteem srom him, who, apparently, had nolhing iri comrnon wjth other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had pasfed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrcy had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's c harclcter, and n0w he found, that, th0ugh many more of his actians were exp0sed to his uiew, the results offered different concIusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His compariion was prafuse in his liberality;—the idle, lhe vagabond, and the beggar, roceived from his hand rnore than enough to relicve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, thal he beslowed his alms;—these were sent fram tbe door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask s0mething, not to reljeve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink hjm still decpcr in his iniquity, he wcls sent away wjth rich cbarity. This was, however, clltributed hy him to the greater importunity of the vic-\nious, which gonerally prevails over the retiring bashfuIness of the virtuous indigont. There was one clrcumstance about the charjly of his Lordship, which was ftlll more impressed uponhis mind: al1 those upon wh0m it was bestawed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffo1d, or sunk tothe lowest and the most abject misery. At Brufsels and other towns through which they passcd, Aubrey was surprized at the apparerit eagerness with whioh his compani0n sought sor tbe centres of a1l sashionable vice; there he entered inlo all the spirit of the faro table: be betted, and aIways garnbled with success, except where lhe known sharper was his antaganist, and lhen bc lost evcn more than he gclined; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with whlch he ge nerally watched the society arourid: il was not, however, so when he enc0untered the rash youthful novico, or the luckless father of anumerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this appclrent abftractedness os mind wcls laid aside, and hls eyes sparkled with more fire than thclt of the cat whilsl dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the sarmerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drown him withinthe roach of this fiend;whjlſt mony a father sat fronlic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his lote immcnse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to scltisfy their present craving. Yet he took no rnoney from the gambIing table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of inany, lhe last gjlder he had just snatched from the convulfive grasp of the innocent: this mjght but be the result of a certain degree of kriowledge, which was not, however, capahle as combating the cunning of the more experieneed. Aubrey often wisbed to represent this to his frlend, arid beg him to rosign that charity and p1easure which proved the ruin 0f all, and did nottend to his own proflt;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportvnity of speaking frankly and ope n1y to him; hawever, this never occurrod. Lord Ruth uen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes ofnature, was alwayf the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and lbaugh Aubrey was near the object of hisouriosity, he obtained no greclter gratisication from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that myslery, wbich to his exalted imagjnatiori began to assume the appearance of sarnething supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time 1ost sight of his companion; be lefl him in daily attendance uponthe mornirig circle of an Italiclri countess, whilst he went in search of the rnemorials of clnother almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, lettors arrived from Englarid, which he opened with eager impatience; the sirst was from his sister, breclthingnothing but affection; the 0thers were from his guardians, the latter astanished him; if ithad before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power refident in his componion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately Ieaving bis friend, and urgcd, that his char acter was dreadfully vicious, for that lhe possession of irrosistjble p0wers of seduction, rendered his licentiouf habitſ more dangorouſ to sociely. It had been discoverod, lhat his contempt sor the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he hodrequired, to enhance his gratification, that hls victim, the partner af his gvilt, should be hurled from tbe pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to lhe lowost abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whoin he had sought, apparently on accovnt of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole dcformity 0f their vices to the publjc gaze.\nAvbrey determined upan leaving one, whose characterhad not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest tbe eye. He resolvcd to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning bim altogether, purposing, in the rnean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstonces pass by unnoticed. He eritered into the same circle, and soori perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperlence of the daughter of the 1ady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried fomale is met wjtb in society; he wcls therefore obliged to carry on his pIans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in oll his windings, and soon discovered thatan assignatiori had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an inriocent, th0ugh thougbtless girl. Lasing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and a6ruptly asked hiin his intentions witb respect to the lady, insorming hlm at the same time that he was aware of his being clbout to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were sveh as he supposed a1l would have upori such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he inte-\nnded to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wriling a nate, lo say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the rernainder os their proposed lour, he ordered his servant to seek otherapartmonts, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed hcr of all he knew, not only with rogard to her daughter, but also concerningthe character of his Lordshjp. The assignation wos prevenled. Lord Ruthven riext day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a sepclration; but did riot hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Avbrey's interposition.\nHaving left Romc, Aubrey directed his steps lowards Greece, and cross-\nlng the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He theri sixcd his residence in the hovse of a Greek; and soon occupied hiinself in tracirig the fclded records of ancient glory up0n monuinents that apparently, ashamed os chronicling the deedf of freemen only before slaves, had bidden themselves 6eneath tbe sheltering soil or many co1oured licheri. Under lhe same roof as himself, existed a heing, so beautisvl and delicate, that she might have f0rmed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope os the f aithful in Mahomet's paradise,savo that her eyes spoke too much mlnd for any one ta think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon lhe plajn, or tripped along lhe mountain's side, one would have thoughl the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompariied Aubrey in his search afler antiquities, arid ofton would the unconscious glrl, engclged in the pursujt of a Kashrnere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of ber form, floating as it were upon the wind, lo tbe eager gaze of him, who forgat the lettcrs he had just decyphcred upon an almost effaced tclblet, in the contemplation af her sy1ph-likc figure. Often would her lresses falling, os she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swift1y sading hues, it might well excuse the sorgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the veryobject hc had bef0re thought of vital importarice to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe eharms which all feol, but none can appreclate?—It was innacence, youth, and beauty, unaffectcd by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. WhiIst he drew lh0se remains of whioh he wished to preserve a memorial for his fvture hovrs, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenos of hor native place; she would then describe to him the circling dclnce upon the open plain, would paint, to him in a11 the glowing colours of youtbful momory, the marriage pomp sbe remembered viewing in her infaricy; and then, turning to subjectſ that had evidently made a greater impressian upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural taIes of her nurse. Hcr eamestness and apparcnt belief of what she narrated, exclted the interest even of Au6rey; and often as she told him the tale of the ljuing vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friendſ, and doarest tief, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femcllo to prolong his exjslence for the ensuing monthſ, his blood wouId run cold, whi1st he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe cited to him the na mes of old men, who had at lasl detected one living among lhemselves, after several of their near relativef and chjldren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and wben sbe found him so incredulous, she beggcd of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who hcld darod to question their existence, always had some proof giuen, which obliged thom, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to hirn the traditional appeorance of tbese monsters, orid his horror was increased, by hearirig a pretty occurate descripti0n of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth iri her fears, lhovgh at the same time he wonderod at the many coincidences which hcld all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural pawer of L0rd Ruthven.\nAubrey beg an to attacb himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocenoe, so contrasted with all the affeoled virtves of the women among whom he had saught sor his visjon of romance, won his heart; ond whiIe he ridicvled the idea of a young man of English hobits, inarrying ari uneducated Greek girl, slill he found himself moro and inore attaehed to the almost fairy form besore him. He wouId tear himselfclt times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiqvarianrefearch, he would depart, deterinined not lo return vntil his object was attained; but he alwayf fovnd it impossible to fix bisatlentlon upon the ruins around him, whilft in his mind he retained an imclge thal seemed alone the rigbtful posscssor of his lhovghtſ. Ianthe was unconsciovſ of his love, and wcls ever the sclme frank infantile being he had first kn0wn. She always feemed to parl from him with reluctance; but it waſ because ſhe had no longer any one wlth whom she could visit her favourite baunts, whilst her guardian was occupied ln sketching or uncovering some fragment whlch had yet efoaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed lo hor parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, asfirmcd their existence, pale with horror at thevery name. Soon after, Aubrey dotermined to procecd upon one of his excursions, which was lo detain him fora few hours; when lhey heardthe name of the place, tbey aIl clt once begged of him not lo return al night, as he must neccssarily pass through a wood, wbere no Grcek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideratjon. Tbey described it as the resort of the vampyres in their noctumal orgies, and donounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross thcir path. Aubrey rnade light of thejr reprcsentations, and tried to laugh them oul of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at bis daring thvs to mock a svperior, lnfernal power, the very name of whicb apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext mornirig Aubrey set off upon his excursion unaltended;he was surprised to observe the mclancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, bad inspired them witb such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side os his horse, and earriestly begged of him to return, ere night alIowed the power of thcse beings to be put ln aotian;—he promised. He was, however, so 0ccupied in his research, that he did nat perceive that day-ligbt would soon end, and that in thc horizon there was ane of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapjdly gather jnto a tremendaus mass, and povr all their rage upon the devoted eountry.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for hiſ delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these soutbern cllmates, is almost unknown; jmmediately the sun sets, nighl begins: and ere he had advanced far, lhe power of the storm was abov o—its ecboing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick hoavy rain forced its way thraugh the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he wos carried with dreadfvl rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, thal he was in the nejghbourbood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves arid brushwood which surrounded it. Dismovnting, he appr0ached, hoping to findsarne one to guide hirn to the town, or at least trusting to obtainshelter from the pelting of the starm. As he approached, the thunders, for cl mornent ſilent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a womcln mlrigling with the stifled, exultclnt moekery of a laugh, conlinued in orie almost unbrokcn sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder whicb again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forcedopen the door of the hut. He found himself iri utter darkness: the sound, howover, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; f0r, though he caIled, still the sounds continued, and no nolice was taken of him. He found himſelf in eontact with somc 0ne, whom he immediately fcized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh sueceeded; and he folt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: detormined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it waf in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurIcd with onormous force against the ground:—his enemy lhrew himself upon him, and krieeling upon his breaft, had placed his hands vpon his throat—when tbe glare of inany t0rehes penetrating throughthe hole that gavc lighl in tho doy, disturbed him;—he instantly roſe, and, Ieaving his prey, rushed through thc door,and in a momerit the crashing of the branches, as be broke throvgb tbe wood, was no longer beard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable af moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon lhe mud walls, and the thatch loaded on euery individual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Avbrey they searched for her wha had attracted hjm by her cries; ho was agaln left in darkneſs; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torcbeſ once mare burst upon him, to perceive the alry form of his fair conductress b rought in o lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hopjng that it was but a vision arising from his djsturbod imagination; but be again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by hiſ side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upan ber lip; yet there was a stillness a6out her face that seemod almost as attaching as the life that orice dwelt there:—upon her neck and breaſt was blood, and upori her throat were the marks 0f teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, slmultaneously struck wjth horror, \"A Vampyre! o Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the ſide of ber who had lately becn to him lhe object of so many bright and fairy visions, now follen witb the f1ower os life that had died w ithin her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benvmbed and seemed to shun rcflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he beld alinost unconsclously jn hjs hand a naked dagger of a particulclr construction, which had beeri found in the hut. They weresoon met by different parties who had been engaged in thc search of her wboma mothcr had rnisscd. Thcir lamentable cries, as they approclched tho elty, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be lrnpossible; but when they ascertained the oause of their child's death, they looked at Aubroy, and poinled to the corse. They were inconsolable; 6oth died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized witb a most violent fever, and was 0ften delirious; in these intervals he w0uld call upon Lord Ruthven and upori Ianthe—by some vnaccountable combinati0n he seemed to beg of his former eompanian to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate malcdictions upon his head, and ourfe him as her dostroyer. L0rd Ruthven, chanoed at tbis time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever inotiue, upori hearlng of the state 0f Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and bocame his oonslant attendont. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and ftartled clt the sight of him whose image he had riow comblned wjth that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hiſ kind words, iinplying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their soparation, and still more by the atterition, anxiety, and caro which he showed, soori reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic heing who had so astonlshed Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradua1ly retired into thc same stateof mind, and Aubrey perceived no difserence from the foriner man, except that at tlmes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile os malicious exultation plclying upon his lips: he knew not wby, but this smjle haunted him. Dvring the last stoge of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparontly engaged jn watchirig lhe tideless waves raised by the coo1ing breeze, 0r in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, llke ovr world, the moveless ſun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the cyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and tbat elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguifhed him now seerned t0 hove fled for ever. He was now as much a Iover af solitude and silence os Lord Ruthven; bvt mueh as he wlshed for solitude, his mind e0uld not find it in the nelghbourhood os Atbens; if he sought it amidst lhe ruins he had formerly srequenled, Iclntbe's formstood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her ljght step would clppear wanderjng amidstthe underwood, in quest of the modest violet; lheri suddenly tuming round, would show, to his wild imagination, her paIe face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lipſ. He determiried to fly scenes, evcry fealure of which created such bitter associations in his mjnd. He proposed to Lord Rvthve n, to whom he held himself bound by the tendcr care he had takon of him during his jllness, that thoy should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet feen. They travellod in every direction, and fought every spot to wbich a recollection couId be attached: but though they thus hastened from p1ace to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. Thcy heard much of robbers, but they gradvally bogan to slight these reports, whieh they imagined were orily the invention of individuals, whose intcrest il was to excile the gener0sity of those whom they defen-\nded from pretended dangers. In consequence 0f thus neglocting theadvice of lhe jnbabitarits, ori one occasionthey travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow dcfile, ot the bottom of which was the 6ed of a torrent, with large masses of rock hrought down from the neighbouring precipices, they hcld reclson to repenl their negligence; for scarcelywere the whoIe 0f the party engaged in lhe narrow pass, when they were startledhy tbo whistling of 6ullels close to their hoads, and by thc echoed report os several guris. In an instant tbeir guards had left them, and, placing themſelves bchind rocks, had begun to fire in tho direction whence tbe report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed 0s being thuſ detained by a foe, who with insulling shouts bade them advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in seorch of tbe eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a sbot in the shoulder, which brought him to lhe ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistancc; and, no longer heeding the contest or his awn peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being woundcd, immediately thrawn up thcir arms and ſurrendered.\nBy promises of great reword, Avbrey soon induced tbem to convey his wounded friend to a neighb0uring cabin; arid havirig agreed upon a ransom, he waf no more disturbed by their presenee—they being content mereIy to guard the entrance till their eomrade should return with lbe promiſed sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strengtb rapidIy decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death scemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appeclrance had not ehangod; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of lhe objects about him: hut towards the close of the last ev ening, his mind became opparently uneasy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to 0ffer his assiſtance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than tbat—I mean not my life, I heed lhe death af my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my horiour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any lhing,\" replied Avbrey.—\"I need but little—iny Iife ebbs apace—I cannot cxplain the wh ole—but if yov would coriceal al1 you know of me, my honovr were free fr0m stain in the world's mouth—and lf my death were unknown for some time in Englarid—I—I—but ljfe.\"—\"It shall notbe known.\"—\"Swcar!\" cried the dying man, raising himse lf with exultant violerice, \"Swear 6y all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for cl year clnd a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or deatb to any living being in any way, whateuer may happen, or whatever you mcly see. \"—His eyef seemed burstlng from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing vpon his pillow, and breathed na more.\nAubrey retired to reſt, but did riot sleep; the many circumstanc es attending his acquaintance witb this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold sbivering came over him, as if from the preseriliment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he wos about lo enter the hovcl in wbicb he had left the corpse, wheri a robber inet hirn, and iriformed him that jt was no langer there, having been conueyed by himsclf arid comrcldes, upori his retiring, to the pinnclcle of a neighbouririg mount, accord-\ning to a promise they had gjven hls 1ordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking seueral of the men, determined to go and bury it upon thc spot where it lay. But, when he had mounled to thesummit he fourid no traco os either the corpse or the clothes, thaugh the ro6bors swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they had laid lhe hody. For a time bis mind was bewildered in conjeetu res, but he at last retumed, convinced that they had buried the oorpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a eountry in which he hadmet with such terrible misfortunos, clnd in which aIl apparently conspired to hcight en that superstitlous melancholy that bad seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naples, he accupjed himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing scvera1 weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the uictim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst tvrning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at firiding a sheath apparently ornamented in thc same ſtyle as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to goin further proof, he found tbe weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, th0ugh peculiarly shaped, tbe sheath he held in his hond. His oyes seemed to need no fvrther certainty—they secmed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet ftill he wished to disbolieve; but the pclrticular form, the same varying lints upon thehaft arid sheath were alike in splend0ur on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on eaoh.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his firsl inqulries were conccrning the lady he had attempted lo snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductlve arls. Her parents were in distress, thelr fortune ruined, ond she had not been h eard of since lhc departure of hif lordship. Aubrey's mirid becclme alm0st broken under so many repeated horrors; be was afraid that tbis lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose arid silent; and his only oecupation oonsisted in urglng the speed of thepostilions, as if he were going to savo the ljfe of soine one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which ſeemed obedient to his will, soon waftcd him to the English shores; ond he hastened t0 the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momont, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of hjs sister, all memory of the past. If sbe before, by her infontine car esses, had gained his affection, now that the womcln began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winnjng grace whicb gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room afsemblieſ. There was noneof that light brilliancywhieh only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartinent. Her blue cye was never lit up by the lovity of the mirid boneath. There was a melanc-\nholy charm about itwhich did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling wlthin, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not tbal light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colovr may attract—it was sedate and pensive. Wben alone, her face was never brlghlened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would iri her presence fargel those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smilo f0r that of the voluptuclry? It scemed as if thoso eyes,—thal sace were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, arid had n0t been prcsented to the world, it having bcen thought 6y ber gvardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's relvrn from the eontinent, whon he mjghl bo her protector. It was now, theresore, resolved that the next drawjng-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of hcr eritry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon tho melanchoIy which overpowcred him. He could notfeel interest ab0ut the frivolities of foshionable strangers, when his mind had been so tom by the events hc had witnessed; but he determined ta sacrifice his own comfort to the protection af his sister. They soon orrived in town, and prepared for the noxt day, which had been arinounced as a drawirig-room.\nThe crowd was excessivo—a drawing-room had not been held for a long liine, and all wh0 were anxious to bafk in the smi le of royalty, bclstenedthither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whjle he was standingin a comer by himfelf, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembronce that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a volce he recognlzed too well, sovnded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had bardly courclge to turn, fearful of seelng a fpeetre that would blast him, when he perceived, al a little distance, the ſarne figure which had attracted his notice on this spot vpon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs a1mostrefusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage throughthe crowd, ho threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, ond fixed his hands vpon his hcad, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bvrsting from his brain. Lord Ruthuen agaln befare him—circumstances started up jn dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himsclf, he could riot believe it poſsible-\n—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the image hif mind was resting upon. It was impassible that it could be real—he determined, therofore, to go again into society; sor thovgh he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could riot succeed in gaining insormalion. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a malrori, he retired irit0 a recess, and there gave himself up to his own de vauring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many wero leaving, he roused himself, and entering clnother room, found hiſ sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he ottempled t0 pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the strect: clt the d0or he sound himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for tbeir lords; arid while hc was engaged in passing them, he agaln heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrylng his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became olmost distracted. Is before his mjnd had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now thal the certainty of tbe monsler's living agoin pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in uain that she intreated him to cxplain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starllod bim;—wos he then to allow this morister to roclm, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not overl its progress? Hjs very sister mlght have been touched by him. But euen if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would 6elieve hlm? He thought of employing his awn hand to free lhe world fram such a wretch; but declth, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes streaming with tears, besougbl him, for her sake, to support nature.At last, no longer capable of bearing stillnoss and solitvde, he lest his house, roamed fr0in street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and hc wandered, os often exposed to the noon-daysun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized;at first he returnod with lhe evening to the house; but at last he laid him dawn to rest wherover faligue ouertook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but thoy were soon distonced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. Hls conduct, however, suddenly changod. Struck with the idea thal be Ieftby his absencc the whole of his sricnds, with a fiend amongst them, os whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, clnd watch him cl0sely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hiſ oatb, all whom Lord Ruthveri approaehed with intimacy. But when he entered into a r0om, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sistcr woſ al Iast obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, for her soke, a fociety which affeoted him so ſtrongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guclrdians thoughl proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becomlng allenated, they thought it high time to reſume again that trvft which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey'f parentf.\nDesirous of saving hiin from the irijuries and sufferlngs he had daily eneountered in his wanderings, and of preuonting him from exposing to the general eye those markf of what they eonsidered folly, they engclged a physician to reside in the house, and lake constclnt care of him. He bardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorhed by one lerrible subject. His incohercrice became ot last so great, that he was conflned to his cbam-\nber. There he would often lie for days, incapobIe of being roused. He bad become cmaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affection and rccollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimesstart, and, ſeizing hcr hands, witb looks that severc1y afflicled her, he would desire her nol to touch him. \"0h, do not touch him—if your love for me is avght, do nat go near him!\" When, howover, she lnquired to whom he refcrred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and agajn he sank irito a state, whence not evcn sbe cou1d rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year waſ passirig, his incoherencef became less frequent, and his mlnd threw off a portion of its gloom, whjlst his guardiaris observcd, that several timos in the day he would covnt upon his fingers a definite number, and then srnilo.\nThe time bad nearly elapsed, when, upon the last dcly of the year, onc of his guardianſ enlering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upori the melanoholy circvmstance os Aubrey's being in so awful a siluation, when his sister was golrig ncxt day to be married. Instantly Avbrey's atlention was attractod; he afked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark af returriing intellect, of wbich they seared he had bcen deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsdon. Thinking this was a y0vng Earl whom he had rnet with in society, Aubrey seomed pleas ed, and aftonished them still more by his expressing his intention lo be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered riot, but in a few minules his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the infIuence of her lovely smile; for he pressod her to his breasl, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at tbe thought of her brother'sbeing once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth,and to congralulate her upori her marriage with a person so diſtinguished for rank and every accomplisbinent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening il, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his lifo. He seized the portrait in a paroxysin of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upori hor asking him why he thusdestroyed the resemblance of her futurc husbclnd, he looked as if he did nol understond her—then seizing hor hands, and gozing on her with a frantic expressiori of counteriance, he bade her swear that she would never wedthis monfter, for he— But he could not advclnce—it seemed as if that voice clgain bade hiin remember his oath—he turned fuddenly round, thinking Lord Rulhven was near him bvt faw no one. In thc meantime the guardians ond physiciari, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a relurn of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired hor to leave him. He fcll upon his knees to them, hc implored, he begged of them t0 delay but sor one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imaginod had taken possession af hif mind, ond eavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had call ed tbe inornjng after the drawjng-ra0m, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned lhat he was deemed insane, his exvltation arid pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. Ho hastened to the house af his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and tbe pretence of great affection for the 6rother and interest lri his fate, hc gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers clnd tails ta recount—cou1d speak of bimself as of an individual having no sympathy with any bolng ari the crowded earlh,save wjth her to whom he addressed bimsels;—couId tell how, since he kriew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy 0f preseruation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing acconts;—in fino, be knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falljng at length to him, he 0btained an iinportant embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's derangedstate,) which was to take plaoe the very day before his deporture for the continent.\nAubrcy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, atternpted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked sor pon and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own hclppiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for o few hours that inarriage, on whicb he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought il better not to barass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night pafsed on without rest to the busy inmates os lhe house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror lhat may more easily beconceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, arid the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosily of the servants at last overeame their vigilanco, they graduolly stole away, leaving him in the custody of ari helpless old woman. He sejzed the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himse1f in the opartinent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the firsl to perceive hjm: he immodiately approached, and, taking his arm by foree, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When ori tho staircase,Lard Ruthven whispered jn bis ear—\"Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride to day, your sisler is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his atlendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no 1onger support hiinself; hls rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he wasconveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his slsler, who was not present when hc entered, as the physician waſ afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom 1eft London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effvsion of blood produced symploms of tbe neclr appraach of death. He desiredhis sisler's guardians might be called, and wheri tbe midnight hour had ſtruck, he related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven bad disappoared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was oIl beforo him, where to choose his place af rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archjpelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the ycar 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this pl acc, and the cortain supply of oattle and uegetables cllways to be had tbere, induce many British vessels to uiſit it—both men os war and merchantmeri; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bountios oinply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; aſ usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst lhe men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myſelf took a rambIe to the cave called Homer's School, and other pIacef, where we had been boforc. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small moriticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Groek os our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island fovr days previous to our arrival in bis felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did n0t choose to qvlt Mitylene, where I am like1y to gel married.He was on odd, bvt a verygood man. The cottclge over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, lbe wine-trader, six hvndred zechines for it, (a60vt L250 E nglish currency,) and has resided there about fourlcen months, though nat constantly; for he sails in his felucca very oftcn to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very mucb, and we lost n0 time in hastenlng to the house where our countryman had resided. We wore kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over tbe mansiori. It consisted of four clpartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-ro0rn, a sitting parlour, clnd a 6ed-room, witha spacious closet annexed. They were allsimply decorated: plain green-stained wolls, mar6le tables on either side, a large myrt1e in the cenlre, and a small fountain beneath, which could bo made to play tbrough the brariches by movjng a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning postvre; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hal1 stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty 6ook-caſe: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedehamber had merely a large mattresſ spread on the fIoor, with two stvffed cotton quilts and a pjllow—tbe cornmon bed throvghout Greeco. In lbe sitting-roorn we observed a marbIe recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whicb were then ina large seaman's cbest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exclmirilng the contents. On the tablel of lhe recess lay Voltaire's,Shakspeare's, Boileou's, arid Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Ziminerman, in the German lariguage; Klopstock'f Mesfiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; se verol small pamphlets fr0m the Greek press at Constantinople, much lorn, but no English 6ook of any dcscriplion. Most of these books were filled with marginal n0tes, written with a pericil, in Italiari and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled al1 over, and marked with slips af paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"Tbe lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them wilh the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his retum; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orderf, he would frown upon me for a weok together; hc is otherways uery good. I once did hirn a servloe; and I hclve the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zeohines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in cl frnall eottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThc clppearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces l0ng and fourteen broad, and the flutod marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it iſ now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surraunded by o light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkoy carpet, berieath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-lops are thus surnished, as upon thom the Greoks pass their ovenings in smoking, drinklng light wines, such as \"lachryma christj,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the lest hand as we entcred the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapeſ, aranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shclde of two large myrtlc bushes, a marble seat withan ornamental wooden back was placcd, on which we wore told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himsels. \"I suppose,\" said the old mari, \"praying\" far he was very devout, \"and always attended ourchurch twico a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe uiew from tbis seat was what may be tormed \"a bird's-eyc vjew.\" A 1irie of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CaIcla, covered wilh olive and myrtle trees in bloom, clnd on the summil of wbich an ariclent Groek temple appeored in majestic decay. A smallstream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until ll was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and cln horizon unshadowed 6y a singlo cloud, termiriates the view in front; and a ljttle on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnvt and palm-trees, several small islands were diſtinctly obferved, studding the light blue wave with spots of emoraId green. I seldom enioyed a view more than I did lhis; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of tbe person who had resided in this romantic s0litude: nono know hls name bul Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" sajd our coriductor, \"oould tell, bul I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visil the Armonlan, but on our return to the town we learnt seve-\nral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was laſt upon lhe island, and even danced with them at the nuplial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to olhers, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat f0r a fisherman who had lost his own in a galc, and he often gave Greek Testamentf to the poor cbildren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we col1ected, lo have been a very eccentric arid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old sriend at tbe cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most 6eauliful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on lhe sea-shore, and he had bought hor a piano-forte, and taught her hlmfelf the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peacefu1 isle of Mitylene; our imaginationſ all on lhe rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, oll our doubts wcre dispelled. Falling in cornpany with Mr. FOSTER, the arohitect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been trclvelling iri Egypt and Greeco, \"The individual,\" faid he, \"a6out whoin you are s0 anxious, js Lord Byron; I mot him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also vjsited him al Mitylene.\" We had n ever then heard of his lordship'f fame, as we had beeri somc ycars srom home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pul into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curjous in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with lhe idea of returnirig to Mitylenc ori some sutvre day; but to me that day will never return. I make this sta-\ntement, believjng it nol quite unintcresting, and in justice to his Iordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling dlsposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributirig in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add loits pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All tbe finer feelings of the beart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo havc thcir seat in hif bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charily appoor to guide all his actions: and his courting the reposc 0f solitude is on additional reasori for marking bim as a beingon whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whofe head Bonevolence hath tbrown her rnantle. No man canroad the preceding p1easirig \"traits\" wjthout feeling proud of bim as a countrymcln. With respect to his loves or pleaſures, I do not assume a right t0 give an opinjon. Reports are ever to he r eceiued wilh caution, particularly when directed against man's moral iritegrity; and he who dares jvstisy himself before that owful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fel1ow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in sccret, and sbun the world's applause, is tbe surest testimony of a virluous heart and self-approving c0nscience.\nTHE END\nGjllet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "clean": "Having left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Wjlliam Po1idori\nTHE suporslition upon which this tale is founded is vory general in the East. Am0ng the Arabians it appears lo be commori: it did not, however, extend itsclf lo the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed jts prefent form since the diuision of the Latin and Greek churches; at whicb time, the ideo becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually incrcased, and formed tbe subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon theblood os lhe yaung and beautiful. In lhe West it spread, with ſome slight variatiori, all over Hungary, Po1and, Austria, and L0rraine, where thc belief cxisted, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portlon of the blood of thoir uictims, who becclme emaciated, I0ſt their ſtrenglh, and speedily died of consumptlons; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their vejns becamedistendcd to sucb a stclte of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of the ir skins.\nIn tbe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible acc0urit of a particuIar case of vampyrism, which is statcd to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appearſ, that upon an examinatlon of the commonder-in-chief and magistrates of the place, tbey positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a cortairi Hcyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been hoard to say, that, at Cass0via, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating sorne of the earth out of tho vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with hls blood. Thisprecaulion, however, did not prevent him from becoming avampyre himfelf; for, about twenty or thirly days after his death and hurial, many persons complained of having beentormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprjved os life by his attacks. To preuerit furlher mischief, tho inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usucll in cases 0f varnpyrisrn) frosh, and entirely free from corruption, arid emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid bl0od. Proof having been thus obtained, they rosorted lo the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreodfully as if he had been cllive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, andthrew the ashes into hif grave. The same measures were adopted with the corsesaf those persons who had previously died frorn vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, beoome agents upon olhers who surviued them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vclmpyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tvrn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monslrous rodomoritade iſ here related, because it seems 6ettcr adapted to illustrate lhe fubjoct of the present obseruations than any other jnstance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is consjdered as a sort of punjshment aftor death, sor some heinous crime commitled whilst in existence, that the deceased is not on1y do0med to vampyrise, but compelled to confine bls irifernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he wos bovnd by ties of kindred and affection.—A suppositiori alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nButfirst on earth, af Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the bl0od os all thy rclce; There from thy daughtcr, sister, wife, Al midnight drain the stream of Iife; Yet loathe lhe banquet which perforce Must foed thy livjd living corse, Thy victims, ere tbey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their si re; As curſing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withored on the stem. But one that for thy crime musl fall, The youngest, best bel0ved of all, Shall bleſs thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart jn f lame! Yel thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's lclst tinge—her eye's last spark, And lhe last glassy glclnce must view Whlch sreezes o'er its lifeless blue; Theri with unhallowed hand shall toar The tresſes of her yellow hclir, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne awoy by lhee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood sha1l drip; Thy gnashing looth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy svllen grave, Go—and with Gaulf and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed thcln they.\nMr. S0uthey hcls also introduced in bis wild but beautiful poein of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, wbo is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she 6est loved whilst in existonce. But this caririot bo supposod to have resulted from the sinfulneſs of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale aſ a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tourncfort gives a long occount in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends lo have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his great work upon this subject, besidos a variety of anecdotes, ond traditionary narrativefillustrative of itseffects, has put forth somc learned dissertatioris, tending to prove it to be a classi cal, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious arid iriteresting notices on this singuIarly horrible superstition might be added; though the present rnay suffice for the Iimitſ of a note, riecessarily devoted to explonation, and which may now be con cluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre if the one in most goneral acceptation, there aro several others syrionymous wjth it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocba, VardouIocha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT bappened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of thoton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upan the mirlh around him, as if be could not participate therejn. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attentiori, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upan the o6ject's face, did not seem to penctrote, and clt one glance to pierce through to the inward workingsof the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. Hif pcculiaritics caused him to be invlted to every house; all wisbed to see him, and those wha had been accustoined to vioIent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennul, werc pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their atlention. In spile of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained o warrner tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emolion of passion, lhough its form and outl ine were beautiful, many of lhe female hunters aflor notoriety altempted to win his ottentions, and gain, at least, some marks of whot lhey migbt term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been thomackery of every morister shewn iri drawing-rooms since her mar riclge, threw hcrself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to ottract his notice:—though in vajn:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as is they were unperceived;—cven her unappalled impudence wos baffled, and she left the field. But though the comman adultress c0uld not influence evon the guldance of his eyes, it was not lhat the female sex was indifferent to him: yel such was the apparent cavtjon with wbich he spoke to the virtvous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew be ever addressed hlmsels to females. He had, bowcver, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether jt was that it even overcame the dread af hiſ sjngular character, or that they were moved by his apparerit hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females wbo form tho boast of thelr scx from their domestio vlrtues, as among those who svlly it by their vicos.\nAbout thesame time, there came to Londori a young gentleman of the name 0f Aubrey: he was an orphan lest with an only slster in the possession of great weal-\nth, by parents wb0 died while be was yet in childhood. Lest also to himself by guardians, who thought it tbeir dvty merely to lake care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit chargo of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cvltivated more his imaginotion than his judgment. He had, hence, that hjgb romantic feeling of honour and candour, whlch daily ruinf so many rnllliners' apprentices. He believod all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was lhrown ln by Providorice merely for the picturesque effeot af the scene, as we seein romances: he thought thal the misery 0f a cottage merely consisted in the vesting ofclothes, whieh were as warm,but which were better adapted to thc painlcr's eye by their irregular folds and various c0lovred patches. He thought, in fine, thatthe dreams of p0ets were the realities of life. He was bclndsome, frank, and rich: for tbesercasons, upon his entering inta the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should descrihe with 1easl truth their languishing or romping favouritef: the daughters at the ſame time, by their brighlening cauntenances whenhe approached, and 6y their spclrkling eyes, when hc opcned his lips, soon ledhirn into false notions os hif talentf and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his s0litary hours, he was start1ed at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax caridles that flickered, nat from the presence os a ghost, bul from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleaslrig pictures and descriptions contained inthose volumes, from which he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreoms, when tho extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched bim; and the very impossibilily of forming ari idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in hlmself, who gaue fcw other signs of his obscrvationaf extemalobjects, than the tacit assentto their existence, implied by the avoidance of lhejr conlact: allowing his linclgination to picture every thing that flclttered its propensity lo extrovagant ideas, he soan formed this objeot irito the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, ratber than the person before hiin. He became acqvclinted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that bis presence was aIways reeognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrasfed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was aboul to travol. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had onIy whetted hls curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for bim to perform the t0ur, whlch for many gerierations has been thoughl neoessary to enable the young to take ſome rapid steps in the career of vioe towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not a1lowing thom to appear as if fa1len from the skies, wheneuer s candalous intrigues arc mentioned af the subjocts 0f pleasantry or of praisc, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately meritioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprifed to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fl atterod by sueh a mark of csteem from him, wbo, apparently, bad nothing in common with other meri, he gladly accepted it, and in a few doys they had passed the circling waters.\nHltherto, Aubrey had had no opporturiity of ftvdying Lord Ruthv-\nen's character, and now he fovnd, that, tbough many more of his aotions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conc1usjons frorn the apparenl molives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, tbo vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than eriough to relieve their immediato wants. But Aubrey covld not avoid remorking, that it was not upon tbe virtuous, reduced t0 indigenco by the misfortuncs attendont even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were scnt from the door with hardly suppressod sneers; bul when the profligate came to ask something, nol torelieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in hif lust, or to sink him slill deeper in his iriiquity, ho was sent away wilh rich charity. This waſ, howevor, attributed by him to the greclter importunjty of the vicious, which genera1ly prevails ouer the retiririg bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstonce about the charity af his Lordship, which was still more impressed upan his mind: all lhase upon whom it was beſtowed, lnevitabIy found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all ejther led to thc scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the mosl abject misery. At Brussels and other townsthrough which they passed, Aubrey wos surprized at the apparent eagernesf with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all tbe spirit of the faro table: he betted, arid always gainbled with success, except where the known sharper wcls his antagonist, and thenhe lost euen more than he gained; but il was cllways with tbe sarne unchariging faco, with which he generally watched the sooiety arovnd: it was not, however, so when he encounlcred the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fatber of a numeraus family; then hif very wish seemedfortvne's law—this appclrent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his cyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat w hilst dclllying with the half-dead mouse. In overy town, he left the formerly affluent youth, tom from the oircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude af a dungoon, the fate that had drawn him withln the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, wilhout a single farthirig of his late immcnse weaIth, wherewith to buy even susficient to sati sfy their present craving. Yet he took no m0ney from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder bo had jvst snatcbed from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result ofa certain degree of knowledge, whioh waf riot, however, capable of combating the cunning of the rnore ex perienced. Aubrey often wished lo represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend to his 0wn profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hopod his sricnd would gjve him some opportunity of speclking frclnkIy and oponly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst thc various wild and rich scenes os nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was ncar lhe object of his curiosity, be obtairied no grealer gratification from it than the constant excitemenl of vain1y wisbing to break that inystery, which to bis exalled imagination began to assume the appearance of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sigbt of his companion; he left bim in daily attendclnce upon the morning circlc of an Italian countesf, whilst he went in search of tho memorials of another olmost deserted city. Whilst he was thvs engaged, letters arrived froin England, which he 0pened with eager impatience; the first was fram his fister, brealhing nothing but affection; thc others were from his guordians, the latter astonished him; if it had before eritered into his imaginatiori that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to giue him sufficient roason f0r the belief. His guardians insifted upon his jmmediately leaving his friend, and urged,that his chclraoter was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduetion, rend ered hif licenlious habits more dangerous to soclety. Il had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he bad required, to cnhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt,should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied vlrtue, down to lhe lowost abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on occount of thoir vlrtue, had, sjnce his departure, thrown evon the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposo the whole deformity of lheir vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on whi ch to rest lhe eye. He resolued to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning hiin altogether, purpasing, inthe mean while, t0 watchhim more closoly, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered intothe same circle, and soon perceived, thal bis Lordship was endeavouring to work upon tho inexperience of the daughtor of tbe lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on hiſ plans in secret; but Aubrcy's eye followed him in clll his windings, and soon disoovered that an assignation had been appoinlod, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, tbough thoughtless girl. Losing no tim e, he entered the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly askod him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time thot he was aware of his being ahout to meel her that very nighl. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions werc such as he suppo-\nsed a1l would hclve upon such an oocasiori; and upon beirig prefsed wbether he intended to rnarry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, tbat from that moment he must dec1ine accompanying his Lordship in the remoinder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant toseek other apclr tments, and calli ng upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning lhe character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven riexl day merely sent his seruant to notify hls complele assent loa separation; bul did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foilod by Aubrey's jnterp0sltion.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directod hif steps towards Greece, and crossing the Penjnsu1a, soon found bimself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in tbe hovse of a Greek; and soori occupjed himself ln tracing the faded reeords os ancierit glory upon moriuments that apparently, asharned of chr onicling the deeds of freemon only before slaves, had hidden thernselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, ſo becluliful and delicate, that she mlght hclve formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvaſs the promised hope os tbefaithful in Mahomet'ſ paradise, save that her eyes spake too much mjnd for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountclin's side, one would bave thought the gazel1e a p0or type of her beautios; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye os animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious Iook of the animal svited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light ſtep of Ianthe often accompani ed Aubrey ln his search after antiquities, and often wauld the unconscious girl, engagod in the pursuit os a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty os her form, floating as it were upon tho wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letterſ he had iust decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the c0ntemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she fljtted araund, exhibit in the sun's ray svch deljcately bril1iant and swiftly fading h ues, it might well excuse the forgetfvlness of the antiquary, who 1et escape from his mind the very objcct he had hefore thought of vital importance ta the proper lnterpretation of a passage in Pausanjas. But why attempt to describe charms which all seel, but none can appreciatc?—It was inn0cence, youlh, and beavty, vnaffected by crowded drawing-rooms aridstifIing balls. Whilst he drew tho se remajns of which he wished to presorve a memorjal for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch tho magic effecls of his pencjl, in tracing the socnes of her native place; she would then deſcribe to him the circlirig dance upon the open plain, wou1d paint, to him in all the glowing colours af youthful inemory, the rnarriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infoncy; and then, turning to subjects that bad evidently mado a grea ter impressjon upon her mind, would tell hiin all the supernatural tales af her nurse. Hcr earnestness and apparenl beljef of what she narrated, exoited the interest even of Aubrey; and often af she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had pclssed years amidsl his friends, and dcarost ties, forced every year, by foeding upon the life of a lavely female to prolong his existenoe for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whil sl he attempted to lough her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ionthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at laft delected one living amorig themselves, after several of t heirnear relatives and children had been found marked with the ſtamp of the fiond's appe tite; and when she found him so iricredulovs, she begged of him to believe her, for il had been, remarked, tbatthose who had darcd to question thoir exjstence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to eonfess it was true. She detailed to him tho traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descriptlon os Lord Ruthven; he, however, still pcrsisted in persuading her, that lhere could be no truth in ber fears, though at the ſame timehe wondered at tbe many coinoidences whjch hadall tended to exoile o belief iri the svpematural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAu6rey began to attach hirnself rnore and more to Ianthe; her jnnoeence, so cont rasled with all the asfected virtues of the women omong whom he had soughl for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man os English habits, marrying an unedvcated Grcek girl, still he found bimself more and more attached to tbe almost fairy form before him. He would lear himself at times from her, and, sorming a plari for somo antiquarian research, he would depart, determined riot to return until his o6ject was attained;but ho always found it impossible to fix his attontion upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image tbal fcemed alone tbe rightful possessor os his th0ughts. Ianthe was uncanscious of his love, and waf ever tbe same frank infanlile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was hecause she had no 1onger clny one with whom she could vifit her favourite baunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelching or uncovering some frogment whioh had yel efcaped the deftrvctive hclnd of time. She had appealed to her parents ori the suhject of Vampyros, and they both, with severaI present, affirmed their oxislonce, paIe with horror at the very name. Saon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon ono of his excursions, which was to detainhim for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, thoy all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through o wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any considerati-\non. They described it as the resart 0f the vampyres in thcjr nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evi1s as impcnding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made ligbt of their representcltions, and tried to laugh thcm out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal p0wer, lhe very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his cxcvrsion unattended; he was surprised to obscrve the meloncholy face ofhjs host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. Whon he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to retum, ere nlght allowed the power of these beings to be put inactjon;—he promised. He was, howcver, so occupiod in his research, that he dld not perceive that day-light would s0on end, and tbat iri tho horizon there was one af those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a trcmendous maſs, and pour all their rage upori the devoted country.—He at 1ast, howevcr, mountcd his horse, determined to make up 6y speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climalef, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sels, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, thc power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain f0rcedits way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked llghtning seemed to sall and radiale at his very feet. Suddenly hls horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rclpidity through tbe entangled forest. The animal at laft, through fcltigue, stopped, and he found, by the glclre of lightning, that he was in theneighbourhood of a havel that hardly liftod itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded il. Dlsmounting, he approached, boping to find some one to gujde him to the town, or at least trusting to obtclin shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the droadfuI shrioks of a woinan mlngling with the stjfled, exultant mockery of a laugb, continued in one almoſt un6roken sound;—he was startled: but, roused 6y the thunder which again ralIed over hiſ head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparentlyunperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice waſ taken of hjm. He found himself in coritact with some one, wbam he immediate1y seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\"to whicha loud laugh fucceeded; clnd he felt hjmself grappled by one whose strength seemod superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against tbe ground:—his onemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his harids upori his throat—when tbe glare of rnany torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbcd him;—he inſtanl1y rose, and, leaving his prey, rvsbed through the door, and in a moment thc crashing of the branches, as he broko through the wood,was no longer beard. The storm was riow still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torohes fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who bad attraoted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was hjs h orror, when the light of the l0rches once more bvrst upori him, to porccive the cliry form of hiſ fair conductress brought in a lifcless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arifjng from his disturbed imagination; bvt he again saw the same form, when he unclosod them, stretched by his side. There was no c0lour vpon ber cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness abovt her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt thcre:—upon her neck and breast was blood, arid upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men polnted, erying, simullarieously struck with horror, \"A V ampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey waf laid by the sido of her wha hod lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen withthe flower of life that had died wilhin her. He kriew not what his thoughls were—his mind was beriumbed and seemed to shvn reslection, and lako refuge in vacclncy—he held alrnost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hvt. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in tbe search of her whom a rnother had missed. TheirIamentable cries, as lhey approached the city, forowarned the parenls of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their gricf would be impossible; but when they ascertclined the causo of their child's death, they l0oked at Aubrey, and p0inted lo thc corse. They were lnconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was sei2ed with a most violent fever,arid was often deliriouſ; in these iritervals hc would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianlhe—by some unoccountable oombination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other limes he would imprecclte maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chclnced at this tjme to arrive at Athens, and, from wbatever motive, upon hcaring of the state of Aubrey, immediate1y placed himself in the same house, and became his constant atteridont. Whcn the lcltter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starllcd ot the sight of him whose image he had now c0mbined with thot of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, irnplying almost repentance for the fauIt that had caused lheir separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his preſence. His Iordship seemed quite ch anged; he no longer appeared tbat apathetic being who had so aſtonished Aubrey; but as soon as his conualescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey porceivcd no djfforence from tho former man, exeept that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intcntly upon him, with a smile of ma1iciovs exultation playing vpon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng lhe last stage of the lnvalid's recovery, Lord Rvthven wcls apparently engaged jn watchlng the tideless waves raised by the cooling breoze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the movoleſs sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this sbock, was much weakened,and that elasticity of spirit which had onee so distinguished him now seemedto hclve fled sor ever. He was now as much o lover ofsolitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bul much as he w ishodfor solitude, his mind could n0l find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the rvins he hod formerly frequenled, Ianthe's form stood by bis side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in queſt of the modest vioIet; then suddcnly turriing round, would show, to his wild irnagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feoture of which created fuch bitter associations ln biſ mind. Ho propoſed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tendor care be had taken of him during bis illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neitber had yet seen. They travelled in every direction,and sought every spot to which a recoIlection e0uld be clttached: but thovgh they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed wbat they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, hut they gradually begari to slight thesc reports, which they imagined were only the invontion of indiv idualf, whose interest it was to excite tho generosily of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequencc of thus neglecting lhe advlce 0f the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled witb orily a few guardf, more to serve as gu idos than as a defence. Uporientering, howev er, cl narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brovght dowri from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent lheir riegligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in lhe narrow pass, wbon thoy were startled by tbe whistling of bullets cloſe to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guris. In an instant thelr guards had lest them, and, placing thcmselves behind rocks, had begun to sire in the directjori whence the report came. Lord Rulhven and Aubrcy, imitatirig their example, retired for a m0ment bchind the sheltoririg turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus d etained by a foe, wha with insulting shouts bade them cldvance, and being exposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbers sh0uld cli mb ab0ve ond lake them iri the rear, they determiriod at once to rush forward in search of the enerny. Hardly had they lost the sbelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received o shot in the shoulder, which brought bim to thc grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer beeding the conteſt or his own peril, was soon surprised hy seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven'ſ being wounded, immediate1y thrown up their arms and svrrenderod.\nBy promises of great rewclrd, Aubrey soon induced them to canvey his wounded fricnd to a neighbouring cabin; and havirig agreed upon a ransom, he wos no more disturbed by their presence—they being content mcrely to guard the entrance till thojr comrade should return with the promised sum, far which he had an arder. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificalion ensued, and death seemed cldvancing with basty slops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as uneonsciouf os pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induccd to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestnefs—\"Assistme! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed thedcath 0f my existence as little as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your fricnd's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"Ineed bul little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if y0v would conceal all you know of mo, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—orid if my death were unknown for some tirne in Englarid—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall n0t be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying mari, raiſing himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day y0u will not impart your knowlcdge of my criines or death to any living bejng ln any way, whatevermay happen, or whatevcr you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" sajd Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pi1low, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired lo rest, but did not sleep; the mclny circumslances attending his aoquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, arid he knew nat why; when he roinembered his oath a cold shivering came over bim, as if from the presentiment of something horri6le awaiting him. Rising early in lhe morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when o robber met hiin, and informed him that it was no long er there, baving becn conveyed by himsels and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed ta tho first cold ray af the moon that rase after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. Bvt, whcri he had mounted to tbe summit ho found no trace of either the c0rpse or the clothes, though lhe robbers swore they p0inted out the identieal rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at lasl returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had met wilh such terrlble misfortunes, and in which all apparently eonspired to heighten that superstitious melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon orrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessol to convey him to Otranto,or to NapIes, he oecupied himself in arranging those effeots he had wjth him belonging to Lord Ruthveri. Amongst other things there was a caſe containing several weapons of offcnce, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilsl turning them over, and examiriing their curious forms, what was hif surprise at finding o sheath apporenlly ornamented in lhe same style as the dagger discovered in tbe fatal hut—he shvddered—hastening lo gain furtber proof, he found the weapori, ond his horror may be imaginod when he discoverod that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seerned to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to thc dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the fame varying tirits upon the hast andsheath were alike in splendovr on both, and Ieft no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hjs wayhome, clt Rome, hjs first inquiries were concernlng the lady hc bad attempled to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivc arts. Her parenls were iri diſtress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of s ince the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid tbat this 1cldy had falleri a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. Hc became morose and silenl; and his only occupation cansisted iri urging the speed af thepastilions, as if he were going to ſave the life of somo one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; cl breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, ſoon wafted him to the English shares; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers,and there, for a moment, appeared to lofe, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of lho past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more allaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning gracc which gains the gaze ond applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of tbclt light brilliancy which only exists in the healed atmosphere of a orowded apartment. Her blue eyc was neverlit up by the levity of the rnind beneoth. There was a melancholy charm abovt it which did not seem to arise from misf0rturie, but from some seeling within, that appeared to indicate a souI conscious of a brightor realm. Hor step was not tbat light footing, which strays where'er a butlerfly or a colour may attract—it was sedclte and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smlle of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would ln her presencc forget th0se griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who wauld havc exchariged her smile for that of thc voluptvary? It seemed af if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own native spbere. She was yet on1y eighteen, and had not been presenled to the world, it having been thought by her guardiaris more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return frorn the continent, when be might be her proleclor. It was now, therefore, resolved lhat tbe nexl drawjng-room, which was fast opproaching, should be the epoch of her enlry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel iriterest about the frivo1ities os fashionable strangers, when hjs mind had bcen so torn by the euents be had wilnes sed; but be determiried to sacrifice bis own comfort to the protection of hjs sisler. They foon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been arinounced cls a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessiue—a drawirig-raom had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While be wasstanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance thal the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddonly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sourided in his ear—\"Remem6er your oath.\" He had hardIy covrage to tvrn, fearfvl of seeing a spectre that would bIast him, when he pereeived, at a little distance, the samc figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed til1 hls limbf almost refusirig to bear their weight, he was obliged to take thc orm of a friend, and foreirig a passage through the crowd, be threw hjmself into hls carriage, and was driven home. He paced lhe raom with hurried stops, and sixed his harids upari his head, as if he were asraid his thougbts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances ſtarted up in dreadfuI array—the dagger—his oath.—He r0vsed himself, he could not beIieve it possible—the dead rise agajn!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind waf resting upon. It was imposslble that it cauld be reol—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask coricerning L0rd Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, ond he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his fister to the clssembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a receſs, and there gaue himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, thal many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrourided by several, apparently in earnest conversation; hc attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him tbose fealures he mosl abhorred. He sprangforward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forccd her tawards the street: at the do0r he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who wore waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged iri passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to hiin—\"Remember yaur oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey bocame almost distracled. If before his mind had been absorbod by one svbject, how much more compIctely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of lhe morister's liuing a gain pressed upon hjs lhoughls. His sister's attentions were now unheedod, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and th0se terrified her. The inore he thought, lhe more he was be wiIdered. His oath startled him;—was he thon to allow this monsterlo roam, 6earing ruin upon his breoth, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. Bvt even lf he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand t0 frec the world froin such a wretch; but doalh, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this stalo; shut up in bis room, he saw no one, and clte only whcn his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughthim, for her sake, to support nature. At last, rio longer capable of bearjng ftillness and solitude, ho loft his house, roamed from slreet to street, anxious to fly thatimage which haunted bim. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnjght damps. He was no longer lo berecognlzed; at first he returned with the everiingto tbo h0use; but at last he laid him down ta reft wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for hif safety, emplayed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, howover, suddenly changed. Struck with the ldea that be left by his absence the wholc of hisfriends, with a fiend arnangst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to entcr again inta society, ond wateh him closely, anxious to f0rewarn, in spile ofhjs oath, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached witb intimacy. But when he entered into a room, bis haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, thot his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking,for ber sake, a ſociety which affecled him so strongly. When, howevcr, remonstrance proved unavailing, the gvardians thoughl proper to intcrpose, and, fearing that biſ mind was becoming alienoted, they thought it high time to resume clgain thattrust which hod been before imposed upon thcrn by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving him from the injuries and svfferingf he had daily encounlered in his wanderings, and of prevontjng him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they oonsidered folly, they erigaged a physlcian to roside in the hovse, and take conſtant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so eompletely was his mind obsorbed by 0ne terrlblc subjeet. His incoherence becamo at last so great, that he was confined to his cham6er. There he wauld often lie for dclys, incapableof belng roused. Ho had become emacialed, his eyes had attained a glassy luslre;—thc only sign of affection and recollectionremaining displayed itself upon the entry os his sister; then hc would somelimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would deslre her not to tauch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love for me is aught, do not go near hiin!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he reserred, hif only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a slate, wherice not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months:gradua1ly, however, as the year was passing, his iricoherences became less frequerit, and his mind thrcw off a portion os its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the dayhe would count upon his singers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tiine had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of hls guardians entering his room, began to converse with hiſ physician upon the melancholy circumfta nce of Aubrey's bejng in so awful a fituation, whon his sister was going next day to bemarried. Instaritly Aubrey's attentiori wos attracted; he askedanxioufly to whom. Glad of lhls mark of returning intcllect, of which tbey feared he had beeri deprived, lhey mentionod the name of the Earl of Marsderi. Thinking this was a yovng Earl whom he had met with in soeiety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them stjll more by his expressing his lntention to be present at the nuptials, arid desiring to see his sister. They answered not, bvt in a few minules his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected 6y the irifIuence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once mare alive to the feelings of affection. He began to fpeak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulclte bor upan her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and euery accompIishment; whon he suddenly porceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding tbc features of the monster who had so long influenced bis lise. He scized the portrait in a paroxysm of rclgo, and trampled it under f0ot. Upon her asking him why he thus deſtroyed the refemblancc of her future husband, be looked as if he did riot understand her—then seizing her harids, and gazirig on her with a frantic expression os covntenance, he bade her swear that shewould never wed this monsler, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if that voice again bade bim remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thiriking Lord Ruthven wos near him bvt sclw no one. In the meantiine the guardiclns and physician, who bad beard the whole, and thought thiswaf but a retum of bis djsorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to Ieave hiin. He fell upon his knces to thern, he implored, he hegged of lhein to delay but for one day. They, attributing this ta the insanity they imagined hcld taken posſession of his mind, endeavovred to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven hod called tbe morning after the drawing-roam, and bad becn refused with every one elso. When he hcard of Aubrey's i1l health, he readily understood himse1f to be the cause of it; but wben be learncd that he was deemod insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly he concea1ed from those among whom he bad gained this lnformation. He hastened to the house af his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and tbeprotenee of great affection for tho brother and interest in his fate, he gradually w0n the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his p0wor? His longue had dangors ond toils to rocount—could speak of himself as of an lndjvidual having no sympathy witb any being on the crowded eclrtb, save with her to whomhe addressed hiinself;—could te1l how, since he knew her, his existence, had 6ogun to seem worthy of preservation, if it wcre merely that he might listen to her soolhing acccnts;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent'ſ art, or sucb was the will of fate, that be gained bor affections. The title of the elder brancb fa1ling at length to him, he obtained an irnportant embasſy, which served as an excuse for bastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) whjch was lo take place lhe very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, wheri he was lcft by tbe physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the fervants, but in vain. He aſked for pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his siftcr, conjuring her, as she valued her own bapplness, her owri honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, wha once held her in their arrns as lbeir hopeand the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that morriage, on whlch he denounced the most heavy curses. The servantf promisod they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thoughl it better not to haraſs any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, whal he considered, thc ravings os a maniac. Night pas sed on without rest to the busy inmates of the houſe; and Auhrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of bufy preparatlon. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Avbrey grew almostfrantic. The curi0sity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, Ieaving him in the custody os an helpless oId woman. He seized the opportunity, wilh one 6ound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the opartment where all were neorlyassembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking hif arm by force, hurried him srom the r0om, speechlesf with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your 0atb, and know, if not my bride to day, yaur sister js dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the o1d woman, had c0me in seclrch of him. Aubrey could no longer support himsels; hiſ rage nol finding vent, hadbroken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was riat mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physiciari was afraid of agitating her. The marriago was solemnized, and the bride and bridegro0m left London.\nAubrey's weakness increasod; the effuſion os blood produced sympt0ms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be c allod, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly whot tbe reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nTbe guardians hasteried to protcct Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, ond Aubrey'f fister had glvtted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING ANACCOUNT OF LDRD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wcls all before him, w hero to choose his place of rest, and Pravidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greoian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vcssels, in the year 1812, wo put int0 the harbour 0f Milylcne, in the island of that naine. The beouly of this plaee, and the certclin supply of cattle and vegetables always to 6e had there, lnduce many British vessc1s to visit it—both men of war and merchantinen; and though jt 1ies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for tbo deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom 0f the bay, and whilst the mcn were emplo yed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle wilh the natives, the c1ergyman and inyself took a ram ble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been beforc. On the brow of Mount Ida (a sma1l monticule so named) we mct witb and engagod a young Greek as our gulde, who told us he had come from Scio with an Engl ish lord, wholeft the ifland four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have token me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd,but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of lt: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his fclucca very often to the differerit islarids.\"\nThis account exoited our curiosjty very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the bouse where 0ur countryman had resided. We were kindly rcceived by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on thegraund-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, o sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. Tbey were all simply decoroted: plain green-slained walls, marble lables on ejther slde, a large myrtle in the centre, and a srnall fountain benoath, which could be made to play through the branehcs by movirig a spring fixed in the sjde of cl small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large cauch or sofa camploted the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozon English cane chairs, and an empty boo k-case: tbere were rio mirrors, nor a single pajnting. The bedehamber had merely a large rnaltreſs spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a plllow—the common bed throughout Greece. In tbe sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told vs, fillod with books and papers, which wcre then iri a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokfpcare's,Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerrnan, in the German language; Klapstock's Messioh; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphletf from the Greek press al Conslantinaple, much to rn, but no English book of any descrlption. Most of these books were fllled with morginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. Thc Messiah waſ literally scribhled alI over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remclrkſ.\nThe oId man said: \"The lord had been readirig lhese books the evening before he soiled, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" ſaid he, \"therc they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, tbat were I to m0ve ane thing without orders, he would frown upon rne for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once dld him a service; and I have the praducc of this farm for the trouhle of taking carc os it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an agod Armenian who resides in a small cotlage iri the wood, and wh0m tho lord brought here from Adrianople;I dori't know for what reaſon.\"\nThe appearance of the houso externally waſ pleaſing. The portico in front was fifty paces long arid fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars wlth black plinths and sret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were eonsiderahly higher than tbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stane balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awnjng of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnifhed, as upon thern the Greekſ pass their evenings in smoking, drinklng light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, clnd enjoying thc evening breeze.\nOn tbe left hand as we entcrod the house, a small streamlet glided oway, grapes, aranges and limes were clustoring togetber on its b0rders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamentaI woodenback was placed, on which we were told, the Iord pasfed many of his evenings clnd nights till twelve o'clock, reoding, writing, and tolking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe viow from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vincyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, couered with olive and myrtle trees ln bloom, and on the summit of whicb an aneient Grcek temple appearcd in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, vntil it was last iri the woods near the mouritain's base. The fea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a fingle oloud, terminates the view in front; and a little 0n tbe left, through a vista of lofly chesnut and palm-trecs, fevoral small islands were distinctly o6served, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald groen. I seldom enjoycd a vjew more than I did this; bvt our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the pers0n who hcld reslded in this romantic solitvde: none knew his namo but Dominick, his banker, who had gorie to Candia. \"TheArmeriian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will nol,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If Ican,\" faid be, \"I dare riot.\" We had not timc to visil the Armenian, but an our return to lbe town we leamt soveral particulars of thc ifolated lord. He had portioned eight yourig girls when he wos last upon the ifland, andeueri danced witb them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thegirls who liue by weaving tbese articles. He also bought a new b0at for a fisherman who bad loft his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a vory eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, whieh our old frjend at the cottage thought proper not to discloso. He hod a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lordwas osten seen walkjng on the sea- shore, and he bad bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himseIf tbe use af it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; 0ur imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece oould he. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eocentricities which mark poeuliar genius. Arrjved at Palermo, clll our doubls wero dispelled. Fal1ing in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had 6oen travelling in Egypt and Greoce, \"The individual,\" faid he, \"aboul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trclvels on the island of Tenedos, and I aIso visited him at Mitylene.\" Wo had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we hcld been ſome years from hame; but \"Childe Haralde\"being put into our hands we recognized lhe recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply djd we regret not having been rnore curious in ovr researches al the cottage, bvt we consoled ourselves wlth the idea of retuming to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this stalement, believing it riot quite uriinleresting, and in justice to his lordship's gaod name, which bas been grossly slandered. He has been described as of anunfeeling disposition, averse to associating wjth humon riature, or contributing in any way lo sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasuros. The facl is directly the reverse, af may bo plain1y galhered from these little anecdotes. All the finor feelirigs of the heart, so elegantly dopicted in his lordship'f poems, seem to have their seat in bis bos0m. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity oppear to guide all his aclions: and bis courting the repose af solitude is cln additional roa son for marking him aſ a being on whose heart ReIigion hath set her sea1, ond ouer whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read thc preceding pleasing \"traits\" wilhout fceling provd of him aſ a countryman. Wllh respect to his loues or pleosures, I do not assume a rigbt ta give an opiriian. Reporls are evcr to be received with caution, particularly wheri directed against man's morcll iritegrity; and he who dares justjfy hjmsels besore that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fcllow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is w0rthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the worId's applause, is the sureſt testirnony of a virtuous heart ond ſeIf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crawn-courl, Fleel-street.",
    "clean": "Aubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale iſ founded is very goneral in the Eaſt. Among the Arabions it appeors to bc common: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; clndit has only assumed its prosent form sinco the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which timo, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in theirterritory, it gradually inereased, and formed lhe subjecl of many wonderful stories, still ext ant, of the dead rising from their graves, clrid feeding upon the blo0d of the young clnd beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungclry, Poland, Auſtrja, and Lorraine, where the belief cxisted, that vampyres nightlyimbibod a certain porti0n of the blood of their victims, who bceame emaciated, lost their strengtb, and speedily djed of consvmptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veinſ becamo distended to such a stote of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from aIl the passages of th eir bodief, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, crediblo account of a particular case of vampyrism, which iſ stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngary. It oppearf, that upon an exclmlnation of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of lhe ploce, they positiuely and unonimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, namod Arnold Paul, had beeri heard to say, that, at Cassovja, on the frontiers of the Turkish Seruia, he had been tarmented bya vampyre, but had found a way ta rid himself of the evil, by eatirig some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing bimself with his blood. This precautjon, however, did not prevent him sroin becoming a vampyre himsels; for, about twenty or thirty days after hls death and burial, mony persoris complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of lise by bis attacks. To prevent furlher mischief, the inhabitclnts hauing consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in casos of uampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the inouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to theaccustomed remedy. A stake was drivon entirely tbrough lhe heart and body of Arnold Paul, al which he is reported to hove cried out as dreadfully as if he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into hiſ grave. The sarne measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyriſm, lest they should, in their tum,become agents upon otherf who survived lhem.\nThe universal 6elief is, tbat a person sueked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThls moristrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of lhe prefent observations than any other inftance which could bc adduced. In many parts of Greece il is con ſidered as a fort of puniſbment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilsl in existence, that the deceased is not only do0med to vclmpyrise, but compolled to confine hiſ infemal viſitations solely to those beings he laved most while upon earth—those to whoin he was bound by ties af kindrod and affection.—A supposition al1uded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBul first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall srom its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blaod of all thy race; There from thy daugbter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere lhey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thau evrſing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stom. But one thatfor thy crirne must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thce with cl father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flarne! Yet thou must end thy tclsk and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which sree2es o'er its lifeless blue; Then witb unhallowed hand shclll tear The tresfes of her ye1low hoir, Of whicb, in life a lock when shorn Affectian's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borrie away by theo Memoriol os thine agony! Yet with thine own bestblood shall drip; Thy gnasbing tootb, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—clnd with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in harror sbrink clway From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutbey has also intraduccd in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corsc of the Arabian maid Onei2a, who is represenled as having returned from the gravc for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existerice. But thls cannot be supposed t0 have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being p0urtrayed throughout the whole of lhe tale as a oomplete type of purlty and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of soveral astonishing casef of vampyrism, to which be pretends to have beeri an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of ils effects, has pul forth some learned dissertati0ns, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well os barborian error.\nMany curious and jnteresting notices on this singvlarly horrible superstition might be added; thovgh the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarlly devoted ta explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely reinarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one iri mast generol acceptation, there are soveral olhers ſynonymous with it, madc use of in various parts of tbe world: as Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHEVAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations atteridclnt upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of thc ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his slngularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, lhe light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a laok quell it, and throw foar into those breasts where thoughtlessncsſ reigned. Those who felt this serisatlon of awe, couId not explain whence it arose: same attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did nol seem to penetrote, orid at orie glanco lo pierce through to lho inward workings of the hearl; but fell upon the check with a leaden ray thclt weighed upon the skin itcould not pass. Hjs peculiarities caused bim to be inuited to every house; all wiſhed to see him, and lhose who had been accustomcd to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleasedat having sometbing in lheir prescncc capable of erigaging their ottention. In spite of the deadIy hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or frointhe str0ng emotion of passion, though its forrn and outline were beautiful, many of the female huntors after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, atleast, some marks os what they inight term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put 0n the dress of a mounte6ank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she ſtood before him, though hiſ eyes were apparently fixed upan her's, still it seemed cls is they were unperceived;—even herunappalled impudence was baffled, and she lest the field. But tbough the commori adultress could nol influenoe even the gujdance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparerit caution with which he spoke to the virtuouf wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed hjmself lo females. He had, howovor, the reputation of a winning tongve; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that tbey were m0ued by his apparent hatrcd ofvice, he was af often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as omang thaso who sully it by their viccs.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with an only sifter in the possession of great wcalth, by parerits who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardiclns,who thovght jt their duty meroly lotake care of his fortune, whjle they relinquished the more important charge of his mlnd to tbe core of merconary subalterns, he cultivatcd moro his imagination than his judgment. Ho had,hence, that high romantjc feeling of honour and condour, which daily ruins ſo many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise wjtb virtue, and thought that vice was throwri in 6y Providence merely for the picturesque effect 0f the seene, os we fee in romances: he thoug ht that the misery of a cottage merely conſisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye 6y their irregular folds and vclrious coloured patchos. He lhovght,in fine, that the dreams of poets were the rea1ities of life. Ho was handsome, srank, and ricb: for those reasons, upon his entering jnto the gay circles, inany mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with Ieast truth their languishing 0r romplng favourites: the daughters clt the same time, by their brigh tening couritenances whcn he approached, and by their sparklirig eyes, when he opened hls lips, soori led him into false riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled clt finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not fromthe presence of a ghost, but fr0m want of snuffing, there was no fouridation in real life for any of that congeries of pleaslng piotures and descriptions coritained in thosc volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some comperifotion in his gratified vanity, he was abaut to reljnquish his dreams, wheri lhe extraordinary being we bave abovc described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tho very irnpossibility of forming an idea of the character of a mari entireIy absorbed in hlmself, who gave few other signs af his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidanoo of their contact: cllIawing his imagination to picture every thing tbat flattered its propensily to cxlravagant ideas, he soon formed tbis ohjcct into thc hera of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acqvainted with him, paid him attentjons, and so far aduanced upon hif notice, that his prescnce wos always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes ofpreparation in — Street, that he was about lo travel. Desirous of gaining someinformation respecting this singulor character, who, till now, had only wbetted his curiasity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable lhe young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towardſ putting themselves upan an equality with the aged, and not allowing them lo clppear as lf fallen fr0m the skie s, wheriever scandalous intrigues are mcntioned as the subjects of ploasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from bim a proposal to jojn him. Flattered by such o mark of esteem from him, who, clpparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they bad passed the circllng waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he fou nd, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclu sions from the apparent motiues to hiſ conduct. His companion was profuse in hiſ liberality;—the idle, the vclgobond, and the beggar, received fr0m his hand mare than enough to relievo their immediate wants. But Aubrey cou Id not clvoid remarking, that jl was not upon the uirtuouf, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant everi upon uirtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sont from the door with hardly suppresscd sneers; but when the profligatc came to ask sometbing, not to relieve his wonts, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, bowever, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which genera1ly prcvails over the retiring bafhfulneſs of thc virtuous indigent. There was one circumstonce about the charity of his Lordship, whicb was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the Iowest and the inost abject miscry. At Brussels and other towns throvgb w hich they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which hif companion sought for the centres of all fashionab1e vice; there ho entered lnto all lhe spiritof thefaro tab1e: he betted, and always gambled with success, excepl where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even inore than he gained; but it was olways with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched thc s0ciety around: it was not, however, so whon he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed f0rtvne's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, arid his eyes sparkled witb more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-decld mouse. In every town, he lefl the formerly asfluent youth, torn from the circle he adarned, cursing, in the soljtude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him wlthin lhe reach 0f lhis fiend; whilst mony cl father sat frantic, amidst the speaking lookſ of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his late immense wealtb, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their preserit craving. Yel he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsivo grasp of the innocent: this might but be the resv1t of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, h0wever, capable af oombating lhe cunning of the more experienced. Au6rey often wishcd to represent this to his friend, and beg him to reslgn that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own prosit;—but he deloyed it—for cach day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to bim; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven jn his carriage, and amjdst the various wild and rich sceneſ of nature, was always thesame: his eye spokeless than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greator gratification from it than the coristant excitement of vainlywishing to breclk lhat mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume tbe appearance of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his compani0n; he left bim in daily attcndarice upon tbo morning circle of ari Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he 0pened wlth eoger impatience; the first was from his sister, 6reathirig nothing 6ut affection; tbe others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagination thatthere was an evil power re sident in his companion, these seemed to give him sussicient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon hif lmmediately lcaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his ljcentious habits more dangeraus lo society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had rcquired, to enhanoc his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urisullied virtue, down t0 the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that all thase femalef wbom he had sougbt, apparentlyon accaunt of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled ta expose the whale deformity of their vices to the publlc gaze.\nAubrey delermined upori leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjrigle brightpoint on which to rcst the eye. He resolvedto inuerit some pIausible prelext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean wbile, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same oircle, clnd soori perceived, lhat his Lordsbip wos endeavauring to work upon the inexperience af the daughterof the lady wbose houfe he chiefly frequented. Iri Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with ln society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plclns in secret; hut Aubrey's eye followed himin all his windings, and soon difcovered that an assigriation had been appointed, which would most likcly erid in the ruin of an jnnocent, though thaughtless girl. Losing no tirne, he eritered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respoct to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his bejng about to meet her that very nighl. Lord Ruthven answered, that hjf intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an ocoasion; and upon being pressed w hether he intended to marry hor, meroly laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment be must decline clccompanying his Lordship in theremainder of thelr proposod tour, he ordered bis servant to seek other apartments, and calling vpan tho mothcr of the lady, informed her of all he knew, nol only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the choractcr of his Lordshlp. The assignatiori was preve-\nnted. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his fervant to notify hls complete assent to a sepclration; but did not hint clny sus-\npicion of his plclns baving been foiled by Auhrey's interp0sition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossirig the Peninfula, soon found bimself at Athens. He lhen fixed his residence in the hovse ofa Greek; arid soon occvpicd himself in lracing the faded records of ancient glory upon inonumenls thot apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemon only before slaves, had bidden th emselues beneath the shelterjng soil or mariy coloured licheri. Under the same r0of as himsolf, existed a being, ſo beautisul and delicate, that sbe might have formed the madel for a pointer wishing to pourtray on convclss the prornised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke t0o much mind for any orie to think she could belong to those who had no sauls. As she danoed upon the plain, or tripped along the mounlain's side, one would bave thovght lhe gazelle a poor type 0f her boauties; for who would havo exchanged her eye, apparenlly the eye of ariimated naturo, forthat sleepy luxurious look of the anjmcll suited but to thc taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acoompanied Avbrey in his ſearch afler antiquities, and often w0uld tbe uncorisoious girl, cngaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty af her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagor gaze of him, who forgotthe letters he had just deoyphcred upon an almoſt effaced tablet, in the coritemplation of her sylpb-like figure. Osten would her tresses falling, as sheflilted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delioately brillianland swiftly fading hues, il migbt well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape frorn his mlnd the very object he hcld before thought of vital importance ta the proper interpretation of a possage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocerice, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawirig-rooms arid stiflirig balls. Whilst he drew thoſe remains of which he wished to preserve o memorial for his future hours, she would sland by, and watch the mogic effects of his penciI, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hjm the circling dance upon the open ploin, wauld paint, to him in all tbe glowing co1ours of youthsul memory, the marriage pomp she remernbered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evideritly made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell hlm all tbe supematural tales of her nurse. Her e clrnestness arid apparent belief of what she narrated, exciled the interesl even of Aubrey; and often as she told hiin the tale of the livjng vclmpyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life os a lovely female to proIong his existence for the ensuirig months, his blood would run cold, whilsthe attempted to laugh her out of svch idlc and horrible fantafles; but Ianthe cited to him the namef of old men, who had at last dclected one living among lhemſelves, after several of theirnear relatives and chjldren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, sbe begged of him to believe her, for il bad b een, remarked, that those who bad dared to question their existence, always had some proof givon, which obliged tbem, with grief clnd heartbreaking, to confess it was lrue. She detailed lo bim the lraditlonal appeorance of these monsters, and his horror waſ increased,by hearirig o pretty clccurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her seors, though clt the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in thesupernatural po wer of Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey bcgan to altach himself more arid more to Ianthe; her innocence, sa contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he bad sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari unedueated Gre ek girl, still he found himself mare and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himsolf at tirncs srom her, clnd, forming a plari for some antiquariari research, hewould depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; bvt he always found it irnpossible to fix his clttentiori upon the ruiris around him, whilst in his mind be retclined an image that seemed alone tbe rightfuI possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uneonscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She olways seemed lo part from biin with reluctance; but il wcls because she bad no longer clny one with whom she could vislt her fav-\nourite haurits, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching 0r uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to ber parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. S0on aftcr, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of bis excursions, which was to detairi him for a few hours; when theyheard the name of lhe place, tbey all at once begged of him not to returnat night, as he must necessarily pass through a waod,where no Greek would ever remain, after the doy had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the mosl hoavy evils as impending upon him wbo dared to cross thejr path. Aubrey made ligbt of their representatioris, and tried to lavgh them out of the idea; but when he saw them sbudder at hif darlng thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNexl morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unottended; he was surprised to observe the melancboly face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earriestly begged of bim to return, ere night ollowed the power of these beings to be pul iri actjon;—bo promised. He was, howcver, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and lhat in the hori2on there was one os those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidIy gother into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counlry.—He at last, however, mounted his ha rse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: butil was too late. Twilight, in these southerri climates, ls almost urikriown; immediately the ſun sets, night begins: andere he had advanced far, thepower of the storm was above—its echoing tbunders had scarcely ari interval of resl—its tbick heavy rain forced its woy through the canopyirig foliage, whilst tbe blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took frighl, and be was carried with drcadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and be found, by the glare of ligbtning, that he was in the neighbourhaod of a hovel that hardly lifted ltself up srom lhe masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he clpproached, hoping to find some one to guidehim to the t0wn, or at least trvsting to obtain she1ter from the pelting of the storin. As he approclched, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a womari mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was start-\nled: but, roused by the thunder which agclin rolled over his head, he, witb a sudden effort, forced openthe door of the hut. Hefound himself in uttor darkness: the sound, h0wevcr, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he colled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was takeri of him. He f0und himself in cantact with some one, whom hc immedialely sejzod; when o vaice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to whlch a l0ud laugh succeeded; and he felthimself grappled by one wbose strength seemed superhuman: determjned to sell his lifc as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the gr0und:—his enemy threw himself upon bim, and kneeling up0n his breast, had placed his hands upon his tbroat—when the glaro of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave ljghtin the day, d lsturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, Ieaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as hebroke through tbe wood, was no longer heard. Tbe storm was n0w still; and Aubrey, incapable of m0ving, was soon heard by lhose without. They entered; the light of their torchef fell upon the mud wa1ls, and the lhatch loaded on every individual straw wilh heclvy flakes of foot. At tbe desire of Avbrey tbey searohed for her who had attracted bimby her cries; he was again left ln dclrknesf; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more bvrst upon him, to pcrcei ve lhe airy form of his fair conductross brought in a lifeless corse. He shut hif eyos, hopirig that it was but a vision arislng from bis disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. Tbere waſ rio colour upori her cheek, not even upon ber lip; yet there was a ſtillness about her face lhat seemed almosl as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having openedthe vein:—to lhis the men pointed, cryirig, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was 1aid by the side of her who had lately been to him tbe objecl of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died withiri her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbod and seemed to shun reflection, and tclke refuge jn vacancy—he held alrnost uneonsciously iri his hand a naked dagger ofa particular constructian, whicb had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been erigaged in the search of her whorn a motber hadmissed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful ccltastrophe. —To describe their griof would be imposſible; but when they aſcertained the cause of their child's death, they looked atAubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were incorisolable; both died brokeri-hearted.\nAubrey being pul to bed waſ seized with a moſt violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervalſ be would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountabIe eombination he scemed to beg of his former companiori to spare the beirig he loved. At othor times he would imprecate maledictionf upon bis head, ond curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ehanced atthis timc lo arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hear jng of the slate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, andbecamc his constant attendant. When the latter recouered srom his delirium, he was horrified and starlled at thesight of him whose image he had n0w combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hjs kirid words, impIying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more bythe attention, anxiety, and cclre which he showed, s0on reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no Ionger appeared that apathetic being wba had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon os his convalescence began to berapid, he again g radually retjred into the sarne state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from tbe former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet bis gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of ma1icious oxultation playing upan hif lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunled him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparcntly engaged in watching tbe tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in markirig the progresſ of lhose orbs, circling, like our world, lhe movelesſ sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish t0 avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, waf much weclkened, and that e1asticity of spirit whioh had 0nce so distinguished hirn now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbaurhood of Atbens; if he s0ught it amidst the rvinſ he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by bis side—if he soughl il in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly tvrning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He deterrnined to fly scenes, every feature of which created suoh bitter asſociations in his mind. He proposed to Lard Ruthven, ta whom he held himsolf bound by the tender care he had taken of him duririg his ilIness, that tbey should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. Thcy travelled in every direction, and sought evcry spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They beard much of robbers, but they gradually bcgan t0 slight these reports,which they imagined were 0nly tbe invenlion of jndividuals, whose intercst it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In oonsequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasi0n they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve aſ guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narraw defile, ot the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large mosfes of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negIigence; for scarc ely were tho whole of the party enga ged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bulIets close to their heads, and by the echood report of several guns. In an instant their gvards had left thom, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the directlonwhenoe the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, imilating the ir example, retired for a moment behirid the sheltering turn of lhe defile: but ashamed of bcing thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts bade them advance, and beirig exposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbors should climb above and take them in the rear, lhcy delermined at 0nce to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to tbe ground. Aubroy hostcned to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contesl or his own peril, was soon surprised by seejng the robbers' faces around him—his gvards having, upon L0rd Ruthven's being wounded, immediately tbrown vp their clrms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey so0n induced thcm to convey his w0unded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransam, he was no m0re dislurbed by their presenoc—they beirig content meroly to guard the entrance lill thelr comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two dclys mortification orisued, clnd death secmed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appearance had not ehanged; he seemed as unconsoious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last euening, his mind became apparent1y uneclsy, and his eye often fixed upan Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! yau may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, yaur friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do ariy thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I necd but little—my life ebbſ apace—I carinot expIain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honovr were free from staln in tbe world's mouth—and if mydeath wero vnknown f0r same time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be kriown.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rajsing himself witb exultant violenco, \"Swear 6y all your soul reveres, by all your naturc fearſ, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your know1edge of my crirnes or death to any living belng in any woy, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hjs pillow, and 6reathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circumstances attending his acquaintance with tbis man rose upon his mind, and he know not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came ovor him, as is from the presentiment of sornething horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the m0rning, he was abovt to enter tho hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed hiin that it was no longer therc, having beeri conveyed by himself and comra des, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, acc0rding to a pramise they had given his lordship, that it should he exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several os the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. Bul, when he had mourited to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clotbes,though the robbers swore they pointcd out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returried, convjnced that they had bvried tho eorpfe far the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of cl covntry in which he had met wilh svch tcrrible misforturies, and in which all apparenlly oonspired to heighten that ſuperstitious melancholy that had seized uponhis mind, be resolved to leave it, arid soon arrjved at Smyma. While waitirig for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himſelf in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhvon. Amongst other things thero was cl case containing seueral weapons of offenco, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. Tbere were several daggers clnd ataghanſ. Whilst turning them over, ond examining their curiovs formf, what was his surprise at finding a sheath clpparently ornamented in tho same style cls the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—bastening to gain fvrther proof, he faund the weapon, and his horror may be imaglried when he discovered that it fitted, though peouliarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular f orm, thesame varylng tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splendour on both,and left no room for daubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Sinyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, hjs first inquiries were conceming the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arls. Her parentf were in diſtress, their fortunc ruined, and she had not been be ard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrcy's mind became almost broken urider so mony repeated horrorſ; he was asraid that lhis lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He becamc morose arid silent; and his only occupatjon eonsisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the lise of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which soemed obedienl to his will, soon wafted him to the English shoreſ; and he hostened lo the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to losc, in the embra ces and cclresses of his sister, a1l memory of the pasl. If she before, by her infantine caressos, had gained his affection, now that the woman began ta appear, she was still more attclching as a companion.\nMiss Au6rey had not that winning grace which gainf the gaze arid applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none os that light brilliancy which only exists iri the heated atmosphere of acrowded aparlment. Her blue eye waſ never llt up by the levity of the mind boneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did nat seem to arise from misfortune, but from some fecling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not tbat llght footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colaur may attract—it was sedale and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her br0ther breathed to her his affeclion, and would in her presenee forget thofe griefſ she knew destroyed his rest, who would have cxchanged her fmile f0r that of the voluptuary? It seemcd asif those eyes,—that face were thcn playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, ond had not been presenled to the warld, it having been thaugbt by hor guardians mare fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the riext drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the ep0ch ofher entry irilo the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have romainod iri tbe mansion af his fatbcrs, and fod upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interefl about the frivolities of fashionabIc strangers, when his mirid had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but hc determined to sacrifice hjs own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in lown, and prepared for the next day, which had been arin0vnced as a drawing-room.\nThe orowd was excessivc—o drawing-room had not been held for a long tlme, and all who were anxi0vs to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was thore with hjs sister. Whlle he was standing in a corner by himself, hcedless of alI arovnd him, engaged in the remembrance that the first tlme ho hod seen Lord Ruthven was in that very pIace—he felt himself suddenly seizedby tbe arm, arid o voice he rocogni2ed too well, sounded in his ear—\"Rernember your oath.\" Ho had hardly courage lo tvrn, fearful of seeing a spectre tbat wouId blclst him, when he perceivod, at a ljttle distanco, lhe same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almast refusing to bear their weighl, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through thecr0wd, be lhrew himso1f into his earri age, arid was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, ond fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursling from bis broiri. Lord Ruthvon again before him—circumstances started up in dreadfvl array—the daggcr—his oath.—He roused himself, he could not belioveit possihle—thedead rlse again!—He thought hiſ imagination had coniured up the image his mind was resting upon. Il was impossible that it could be real—hc detormined, therefore, to go again into sociely; for thougb he clttempted to ask conceming Lord Ruthven, the name bung vpon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining insormation. He went a few nights after with his sister lo the assembly of a near relaliori. Leaving her under the pr0tection of a inatran, he retired into a recess, and there gave hlmsolf up to his own devouring tboughtf.Perceiving, at last, that many were loavlng, he roused hjmself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appareritly in earnest converſation; be attempted topass and get near her, wbenone, whomhe requested tomove, turned rourid, and revealed to him those featvres he most abhorred. He sprarig forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, soreed her towards the street: at lhe door he found bimself impeded by tbe crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; arid while he was engaged in possing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached bome.\nAubrey became alm0st distroctod. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was jt engrossed, now that the certainty of the monfter's living again pressed upon hif thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, ond it was in vain that she lntreated hiin to explain to her what had eaused hiſ abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The rnore he thought, the more he was bewildered. Hls oath startled him;—was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upan his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspici0ns, who would belleve him? He thovght of employing his awn hond to frec tho world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in tbis state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and atc only when his sjster came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, far her sake, t0 support nalure. At last, no langer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his houfe, roamod from street to street, anxiaus to fly that image which haunted bim. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but al last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his fafety, employed peoplo to follow him; bvt they were soon distanocd by him who fIcd from a pvrsuer swister than any—from tho ught. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea thclt he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst thom, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to onter again into society, and watch hlm closely, arixi0us to forcwarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached wjth intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderirigs so visib1e, that his sister was at 1ast obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Whon, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, lhe guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mlnd was becoming alienated, they thought it high tiine toresume againthat trust which had 6ecn before imposed upon thern by Aubrey's parents.\nDe sirous of sclving him from lhe injuries andsufferings he had daily encountcred in his wanderings, and of preventjng him from exposing to the general eye tbose rnarks os what they considered foIly, they engaged cl physician to reside in the house, and lake constant cclre os him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his inind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence 6ecame at last so great, that he was eonfined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, inoapable of being roused. He bad become emaciatcd, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affection and rocollectian remaining displayed itself upori the entry of his sister; then he w ould sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks tbat severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not toucb him—if your l0ve for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Whcn, howev-\ner, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence nol even sbo cauld rouse him. This lasted rnany months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and biſ mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardianſ observed, tbat sevcral times in the day ho would count vpon his fingers a definite number, and theri smile.\nThe timehad nearly elapsod, when, upan tho last day of the year, one of his guardians entoring his room, began lo convcrse with his physician upon the melancholy eircumstanoe of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was golng next dcly to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attentiori was attracted; he aſked anxiously to whom. Glad of tbis mark of returnjng intellect, of which they fearcd he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Eclrl of Marsden. Thinking this was a yourig Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey soemed pleased, arid astonished them ftill more by his expressing bis inlention to be present ot the nuptials, and dcsiririg to see hls sistcr. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sistcr was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the irisluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed hcr to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thoughtof her brotber's being once inore alive to the feelings of affectiori. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage wilh a perfon so distinguished for rank and every acc0inplishmerit; when he suddenly perceived a locket vpon her breast; operiing it, what was his svrprise at beholding the features of the manster who had so long influenced his llfe. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, orid trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future hvsband, be lo0ked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on hcr wlth a fraritic expressi0n of countenanee, he bade her swear that she would never wcd this monstcr, for he— But he eould not advance—it seemed as if that voice agajn bade him remember his oath—he tvrned suddenly round, lhinking Lord Ruthven waf noar him but saw no one. In the meantimethe guardians and physiciari, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a relurn of hiſ disorder, eritered, and forclng him from Miss Aubrey, desired hor to loave him. He fell upon his knees to them, be implored, he bogged of them to doloy bvt for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to paeify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had called the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone elsc. When he beard of Aubrey's ill health, he readjly understood bimself to be the cause of it; but when he leorned that he was deemed insane, his exullation and pleasuro could hardly be concealed srom those ainong whom be had gained this iriforination. He haftened to the house of hjs former companion, and, by constarit atlendance, and the pretence of great affection far the brolher and interest in his fate, he gradually wori the eor os Miss Aubrey. Who could rcsist his power? His tongue had dclngors and toils to recount—could speak of hjmfels as of an individual hauing no sympathy with any being on the erowded earth, sove wilh her to whom he addressed himfelf;—could tell how, since he knew her, his exjstence, had begun to seem worthy of preſervation, if it were merely that be might Iisten to ber soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use thc serpent's art, or sucb was the will of fate, lhat he gained her affections. The tjtle of the elder 6ranch falllng at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as ari cxcufe for hastening tho inarriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to lake place lhe very day before his departure for the conlinent.\nAubroy, when he waf left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He aſked for pen clnd paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she volued her own happjness, hcr own horiour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who ance held her in their clrms as tboir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hovrs that morriage, on which he denounced the rnosl heavy curses.Tho servants promised they would deliver it; butgiving it to the physician, be thoughl it bettor not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a mariiac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmatos ofthe house; ond Aubrey heard, witb a horror tbat moy more oasily be conceived than described, the nates of busy preparalion. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Avbrey grewaImost frclntic. The curiosity of the scruarits at lclst 0vercame their vigilance, they gradually stoIe away, leaving him in the custody of ari helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bovrid wcls ovt of the room, and in a momcnt found himsclf in the apartment where alI were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the flrst to perceive hjm: he immediately approacbed, and, taking his orm by sorcc, hvrried him from the room, ſpeechless with ragc. When on tbe staircafe, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his eclr—\"Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride lo day, your sister is dishorioured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towardſ hls attendarits, who, roused by the o1d woman, had come in seareh of him. Au6rey could no longer support himself; his rage n0t finding vent, bad broken a blood-vessel, and he was conueyed to bed. This was not mentioncd lo his sister, who wasnot present when he entered, as the phyfician was afraid of agitoting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Londori.\nAubrey's weakriess increased; the effusion of blood prodvced symptoms of the near opproach of death. He desjred hif sister's guardiaris might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related compo sedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when lhey arrived, it was too lote. Lord Ruthven had disappeclred, and Avbrey's ſister had g1utted thc thlrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF L0RD BYRON'S RESIDENCEIN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before bim, where to choose his place of rest, and Providerice his gvide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mityleric, in the island of thal name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetahles always to be had thore, induee many Britisb vesseIs to visit it—both men of war and merchantinen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound lo Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation ofa voyage. We landcd; as usual, at the boltom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in walering, and the purser bargaining sor cottle with the natives, the clergyman and myself taok o ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and olhor places, where we had boeri bofore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us be had come from Scio witb an Eng1ish lord, who left the island four dayspreviouf lo our arrival in hls felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and w0uld have taken mo with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good inan. The cottage aver the hill, facing lhe river, belongs to him, and he has left an old inan in charge of il: he gavo Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred 2echines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided thore abaul fourteen m0nths, though not constantly; for he sails in his feluoca very often to the different islandſ.\"\nThis accourit excited our ouriasity very mvch, and we lost no time in hostening to tbe house whore our countryman had resjded. We were kindly receiued by an old man, who coriductod us over thc mansion. It consisted of fovr apartments on the ground-fIoor—an entrance hall, adrawing-room, a ſittirig parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious cl0set annexed. They were all simply decorated: ploin green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centrc, arid a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the brclnches by movlng a spring sixedin tbe side os a smal1 bronze Venus in o leariing posture; a largc couch or sofa compleled tbe furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen Engliſh cane chairf, and an cmpty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fingle painting. The bedchainber had merely a large mattreſs spread on the floor, wjth two stuffed cotton quiltf and a pillow—the oommon bed throughoul Greece. In the sittlng-room we obserued a marble recess, formerIy, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whicb were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justifjed in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Bail-\neau's, arid Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermon, in the German language; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradisc Last, an Italian odition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampb1ets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much tom, but rio English book of any doscription. Most of thesc books were filled with marginal notes, wrilten wilb a pencil, in Italicln and Lotin. The Messiah was literally scribblcd all over, arid markod wilh slips of paper, on which also were rcmarks.\nThe old mon sald: \"Tbe lord had been reading thcse books the eveningbef0re he salled, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lio until his return; for hc is so particular, that were I to mave orie thingwithout orders, he wov ld frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did hlm a service; and I have the produce af thif farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Arrnenian who resides in a sinall cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know sor wbat reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externalIy was pleasing. The portico in front waf fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and tho fluted marble pi1lars with black plinths andfret-work carnices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the r0of. The roof, surrovnded by a light stone balvstrade, was covered by a fino Turkey carpet, benealh an awning of strong coarselinen. Moft of lhe house-tops are thus furnished, as upon thein the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, dr inking lighl wines, such as \"lachryma chr isti,\" eating fruit, andenjoying the evening breezc.\nOn the left hand as wc entered the houfe, a smaIl streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limef were clustering together on its bordors, and urider the shade of two lclrge myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornam ental wooden back was placed, on whicb we were told, the lord passed many os his eve-\nnirigs and nightf till twelve o'clook, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the ald man, \"prayirig\" for hewas very devout, \"and always altended our church twice a weok, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be tormed \"a bird'f-eye view.\" A lino of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and ori the summit of which an anc ient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smaIl stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it wos lost in the woods neclr the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and ari horizon unshadowed by a singleeloud, terminates the view in sront; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and paIm-trees, seve ral small islands wcre distinclIy observed, ſtudding the light blue wave with ſpots of emerald green. I se1dorn enjoycd a view more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitIess asto the name of the pcrson who had resided in this ramantic solitudo: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"Is I oan,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" Wo had not lime to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt sevoral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portionod eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow lo one man, horses to others, and cotton arid silk to the girls who livoby weavirig theſe articles. He a1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost hisown in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared lo uf, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benovolent charaoter. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a moft beautisul daughter, withwhom tbe lord was often secn walking on tbe sea-shore, and he had 6oughl her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infarmatiori with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mjtylene; our imaginations clll on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greecc could be. He had money it was evident: be had philanthropy of disposition, and all those ecccntricilies which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubtſ were dispellod. Falling in company wlth Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who bad heen travolling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I a1so visited him al Mitylene.\" We had never then heord of hls lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe HaroIde\" being put into our bands we recognized the reoluse of Calcla in every poge. Deeply did we regret not having been more curjous in our researches at the cotlage, but we consolod ours elues with the idea of returning to Mitylene on soine future doy; but to me that day will never return. I inake this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grosfly slandered. He has been described as of an unseeling disposition, overse to assoclating with humannalure, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or odd to its pleasures. Tbe sact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted jn hjf lordship's pocms, seem to havo their seat in bis bosom. Tenderness, sympath y, and charity appear to guide all hiſ actions: and hjs courting the repoſe os solitude ls an additional reoson for marklng him as a being on whofe hearl Roligion halh set her ſeal, and over whose head Benevalence hath thrown her manlle. No man can read the preceding ploasirig \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a countryinan. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to gjve an opinion. Reports are ever to be rccejved with caution, particularly when directed ogainst man's morol integrily; and he who dares justlfy himself before thatawful trihunal wbero all must appear, alone may cenſuro the crrors os a sellow-morta1. Lord Byron'f character is worthy of hiſ genius. To do good in secret, and shuri the world's applause, ls lho surest testimony of a virtuous hcart and self-clpproving conseience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prinler, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "clean": "Next morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon whioh thiſ tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to 6e comman:it didriol, howeuer, extend itself to the Greeks unti1after the establishinent af Christianity; clnd it has orily assumed its presonl farm sirioe the division of the Latin and Greek churcbes; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thot a Latjn body c0vld not corrupl if burled in their territory, it gradually increased, and formcd the subiect of many wonderful stories,still cxlant, of the dead rising frorn thoir graves, and feeding upon the bload os the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Polarid, Austria, and L orraine, wherc the belies existed, that vampyres riightly imbibed a certalri portion os lhe blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consurnptionſ; whilsl these human blaod-suckers fattened—ond their veins becamedistended to such a state of replelion, as to cause the blood ta flow from oll tbe passages of their bodies, and even from the very poref of their skjns.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curlous, and, of course, credible accovnl of a pclrticular case of vampyrism, which is staled to have occurred at Madroyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chicf and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously afsirmed, thal, about five years bofore, a eortajn Heyduke, riamed Arnold Poul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the frantiers of the Turkiſh Servia, he had been tormented by cl vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himsolf of the evil, by eating some of the earth aut of the vamp-\nyre's grave, and rubbing himsolf with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hjmself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons comp1ained of having been tormerited by hjm, and a deposition was made, that four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitanls having consultcd their Hadagrii, took up the body, and fovnd it (af is supposed lo be usua1 in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from eorruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fl0rid blood. Proos having been thus obtained, they resorted to thc accuſt0med reinedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body af Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hclve cried out as dreadsully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, bur ned hiſ bady, and threw tbe ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the eorses of lhase persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, 6ecome agerits upon olhers who survived thom.\nThc universal bolief is, that cl person sueked by a vam-\npyrc becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is bere related, bec ause it seems better cldapted to illustrate the subject of tbe presenl obfervations than any other lnstance which could be adduced. In many partf of Greece il iſ considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heirious crime committed wbilst in existence, that the deoeased is not only doomed to uampyrise, but compeIled to confine hiſ infernal visitatlons so1ely to those heings heloved most while upon earth—those to whom be was bound by ties os kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, aſ Vainpyre sent, Thy c0rse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly havnt the native place, And suck the blood af all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnjght drain the stroam of life; Yet loathe the banq uet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursirig thee, thou cursjng them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloued of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shal1 wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou inuft end thy task and mark Her cheek's laft tinge—her eye's last spark, And the lasl glassy glanco must view Whioh freezes o'er its lifeleſs blue; Then with unhallowed hclnd sha1l tear Tbe tresses of ber yellow hair, Of whlch, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now ls borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet wilh thine own best blood sball drip; Thy gnasbing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and wlth Gouls and Afrits raue, Till these ln horror shrjnk away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him fhe best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resu1tcd from the sinsulness of her life, she being pourtrclyed througbout the whole of the tclle as o c0mplete type of purity and lnnocence. The veracious Taurnefort gives a long account in his traveIs of severa1 astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he prctendsto have been ari eycwitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its efsects, has put f0rth some learned dissertatjons, tending to prove it to be a elasſical, as well as barbaricln errar.\nMany curiouſ and interesting nolices on lhis sirigularly horrible superstitjon might be addod; though the present may susfice for the limits of a note, riecessarily deuoted to explanalion, orid which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the terin Varnpyre is the one in most gene-\nral acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various pclrts of the world: as Vrouc0locha, Vardoulacha, Gaul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the mjdst of the dissipationsattendant upon cl London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, moro remarkable f0r his singularilies, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could nol participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his altention, that he rnight by a look quell it, and tbrow fear into those breasts where thaughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could n0t explain whence it arose: some attributed it to tho dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance lo piorce through lo the inward workings of the heart; bul fell upon tbe cheek wlth a Ieaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities causcd him tobe invited to every house; al1 wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to vlolent excitement, and n0w felt the weight of enriui, were pleased at having something in their prefenco capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained o warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though itſform and outlirie were beautiful, many of the female hunlorſ after notoriety attempted ta win his attentionſ, and gain, at least, ſome marks of what they rnight torm asfection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sbewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herſelf iri his way, and did all but put on the dress af a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood boforc him, thaugh hls eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it scemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the fieId. But though the common adullress could not influcnce even the guidonce of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent lo him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, tbat few knew he ever addressed himsclf to fcmales. He had, however, tbe reputation of a winning tongue; clnd whether it waf that it even overc-\name the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by bis apparent hatred of vlce, he was as often among thoso females who form the boaſt of their sex srom tbeir domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vjces.\nAbout the same tiine, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Auhrcy: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by pclrents who died while he was yel in childhaod. Left also to himseIf by guardjans, who thoug ht it tbeir duty morely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit cbarge of hiſ mind to tbe oare of mercenary svbalterns, he cultivatcd more his imaginalion than his jvdgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily rui ns so many rnilliners' apprentices. He believed all to fympathise with virtue, and thought that vjce was thrown in by Prouidence merely for the picturcsque effeot of the sceno, os we sec iri romancef: he thought tbat the misery 0f acotlage merely consisted in the veslingof clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thoughl, in fine, that the dreams of poets were tho realities of life. Ho was handsome, frank, and rich: for thcse reasons, upon his entering into thc gay circles, many mothers surr0unded hirn, striving which should describe with least truth their lariguishirig or romping favourites: the daughters at the same tjme, by their brighteriing countenances when he approached, and by thejr sparkIing eyes, wben he opened his Ilps, soon led himinto false notians of his talents and his merit. Attached as he waf to the romance of his solitary hours, he was starlled at fjnding, that, except in the ta1low and wax candles lhat fllckered, not from the presence of a gbost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundatlon in real life for any of that congerles of pleasing pictures and descriptions contclined in those volurnes, from whicb he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compcnsation in hiſ gratjfied vanity, he was about to relinquisb his dreams, when the extraordinory being we have above desoribed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tbo very impossibility of forming an idea of tbe character of a man entirely absor6ed ln hjmse1f, who gclve few other signs of hiſ 0bservation of exterrial objectſ, thcln the ta cit assent to their existence, implied bythe avoldance of their contact: allawing his imagination to picture euery thirig that flatterod its propensity to exlravagant ideas, he soon formed this objecl into the hero 0s o romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rclther than the persori hefore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon bis notice, tbat his presence was always recognlsed. Ho gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affalrs were embarrasſed, arid soon found, from the noles of preparation in — Street, lhat ho was about ta travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting lhis singular character, who, till now, had only whetted hiscuriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, whieh for inany generations has been thought neoessary to enable the young lo toke some rapid sleps in the careor of vice towards pulting lhemselves upon an equalitywith tbo aged, and not aIlowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandcllous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or af prclise, accarding ta the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immodiately mentioning his lntentlonſ to Lord Rutbven, wos surprised to receive from him a propasal to join him. Flattered by such cl mark of esteem frorn him, who, apparently, had nothing jn common with other men, ho gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubreyhad had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven'f character, and riow he found, that, though many more of hjs actioris were oxpoſed to his view, the results ofsered different conclusions fr0m the apparent motives to his conduct. His cornpclnion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from hif hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubroy c0uld not clvoid remarking, thot it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigoncc by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door wilh bardly suppressed sneers; bul when the profligate came to afk somcthing, nat lo relieve hif wants, but to allow him towallow inhis lust, or to sink him still dceper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich cbarity. This was, however, attrihuted by him to thegreater importunity of lhe vicious, which general1y prevails over the retiring basbfuInefs of lhe virtuous indigent. Thero was one circuinstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mjnd: alI thase upon whom it was bestowed, inovitably found tbat there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to tbe lowest and the mosl abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through wbich lhey passed, Au6rey was surprized at the clpparenteagerness wilh which his companion sought for the centres of all fashioriable vice; there he entered into all the fpirit of thc faro table: he bett-\ned, and always gambled wilh sucoeſſ, except where the known sharper was his anlagonist, and lhen he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the sclme unchanging face, with which he gonerally watched the societyar0und: it was not, however, so when he ericountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous s amlly; thon bis very wjsh seemed fortune's law—thiſapparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with inore fire than thot af the cat whilst dallying with the half-deod mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluont youth, lorn from the circle headorned, cvrsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate thclt had drown him wit hin the reach of this fiend; whilst many a sather sot frantic, amidst the speaking 1ooks of mute hungry children, without a sirigle farlhing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner os many, the last gilder he hcld just snatched from thc convulsive g rasp os the innocent: this might but be tbe result of a certain degree of knowledge, whjch was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey oftcn wished to reprefent this to his frlerid, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved therujn of oll, and did not tend lo his own profit;—bul he delayed it—sor each day he hoped his friend would give bim some opportunity os speaking frankly and oponly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his earriage, and amidst the vclrious wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye sp0ke less than his lip; clnd though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gralification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that myste ry, which to his exolted imaglnation began to assume the appeararice of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, clnd Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he loft him in daily attendance upon thc morning oircle of an Italian countess, whilft he went in search of the memorials of another almoft deserted city. WhiIst be was thus engclged, letters arrived srom England, w hich he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection;the others were fr0m his gvardians, thc latter astonished him; if it had bef0re entered into his imagination that there was an evll power residonl in his companian, these seemed to give him suffjcient reafon for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately lcaving his frierid, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the passession af irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habitsmore dangerous to society. It had been discavered, thal his contempt for the adu1tress had nol originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to erihance his gratificotiori, that his victjm, the partner os his guill, should be hurled from the piririacle of unsullied uirtue, down to the lowest abyss af insamy and degradation: in fine, that all thase females whom he had fought, apparentIy on clccovnl of their virtuc, had, since hls departure, thrown even thc mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposethe whole deformity of lheir uices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon loa ving one, wbose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plavsible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in lhe mean while, to watch him more clofely, and to lot no slight circumstances poss by vnnoticed. He entered jnto the same circlc, and soon perceived, that his Lordship wos endoavouring to work upon tbe inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Ital y, it is seldom tbat cln unrnorried female is inet wilh in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in clll his windings, and soon diſeoverod that an assignation had heen appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment af Lord Ruthvcn, ond abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, lnforming him at the fame time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthveri anfwered, that his intentions were such af he suppased all would have vpon such an occafion; arid upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Auhrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying hif Lordship in the remainder of theirproposed tour, hc ordered his servant to seek other clpartments, arid calling upon tho mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only witb regard to ber daughler, but alsa concernirig the character of his Lordship. The aſslgnation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his soruant lo notify hls complete clssent to aseparation; but did not hint any ſuspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left R0mc, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crosfing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residcnce in tho house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the saded records of ancienl gIory upon monumentſ that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden lhemselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured licheri. Urider the same roof as himself, existed a being, fo beautisul clnd dclicate, lhat she might have sormed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on eanvass the promised h0pe of the faithful iri Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyos spoke too much mind for any one lo think she could belong to lhose who had no souls. As she dariced upon lhe plain, or tripped al0ng the mountain'fside, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; sar who would havo exchanged her eye, appareritly tbe eye of animated naluro,for that sleepy luxurious look os the ariimal sujted but to the tasle os an epicure. The lighl step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey iri his search after antiquities, arid often would the uncoriſcious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a K ashmerc butterfly, show the wh0le beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagcr gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had jusl decyphered upon an almosl effaced tablet, in the oontemplation of ber sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses fa1ling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun'ſ ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fadirig hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, wbo let escape from his mind the very objoct he had before thought of vita1 importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all feel, but none can appreelate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-ro0ms ond ftifling balls. Whilst he drew tbose remains of which he wisbed to preserue a memorial f0r his future hours, she wouId starid by, and watch the magic cffects of bis pericil, in tracing the scenes 0f her native place; she would then describe to hlm the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to hirn ln all the glowing colours of yaulbful memory, the marriage poinp sbe remembered viewing in her infaney; and then, turning to subjects that had cvidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talos of her nurse. Her earncstness and appare nt belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even af Aubrey; arid oflen as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his frie nds, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fema1e to prolong his exiftence for the ensuing months, his blood would ruri cold, whilst he atternpted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe cited to him the nomes of old men, who had at last delected one living among tbemſelves, after several of their near rclatives and ehildren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend'f appetite; and whcn she found him so ineredulous, she begged of him lo believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question thejr existence, always hodsome proos giveri, wbich obliged them, wlth grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him tbe traditional appearance of the se monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rutbven; he, however, still perſisled in persuading her, that tbere could be no trulh in her fearſ, th0ugh at tbe fame time he wondered clt the many coincidences wbich had all tended to excite a belief in tbe superncltural power of Lard Ruthven.\nAubrey beg an to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted wlth al1 the affected vlrtues of the women among whom he had sought for hls vision of romarice, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea af a y0ung man 0f English habils, marrying an uneducatedGreek girl, still he sound himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself clt times from her, and, forming a plan for some anliquarian researcb, he would depart, determined not to return vntil his objcct was attajned; but he always found it impossiblc to fix his attention upon the ruins araund him, whilst in his mind he retained ari image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his l0ve, and was ever thc sclme frank infantile being he had first known. She cllways seerned to part from hjm with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketchjng or uncovering some fragrnont wbich had yet escaped the destructjve band of timc. She had appealed to her parents on lhe subject of Vampyres, and they both, with soveral present, offirmed their existenoe, pale with horror at the very naine. Soan after, Aubrey determlned to proceed upan ane of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him n0t to relurn at night, as he must necessarily pclss through a wo0d, where rio Greek would ever rernairi, after tbe day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vompyres in their nocturnal orgios, and denoun-\nced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cr oss tbeir path. Aubrey made light of their represenlations, and tried ta laugh them oul of the idea; but when he saw tbem shudder at hiſ daring thus t0 mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of which apparentIy made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext m0rnirig Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatterided; he was surprised to obſerve the melancholy face of his host, and wos concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of th0se horrible fiends, hcld lnsplred them with such terror. When bo was ab0ut to depart, Iaritbe came to the side of his h0rse, and carnestly begged os him to return, ere night allowcd the power os these beingſ to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that dcly-light would foon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks whioh, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gatber into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon thc devoted eountry.—He at last, howevcr, mounted his horse, determlned to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilighl, in lhese southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he bad advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its ochoing thunderf had scarcoly an intorval of rest—its thick heavy rojn forced its way through tho canopying foliage, whilst tbe blve forked lightnirig seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Svddcnly his horfe took fright, and he waſ carried with dreadful rapidity throvgh the critangled f0reſt. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of ljghtning, that he was in tbe neighbourbood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood whicb surrovnded it. Dismounting, he approaehed, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter fr0m the pelling of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear tbe dreadful shrieks of cl woman mjngling with lhe stifled, exultarit mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost uribroken sound;—he was slartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his hcad, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He sound himself in utter darkness: thc fo und, bowever, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds c ontlnued, and no n0tice wos taken of bim. He found hiinself iri eontact with some one, whom he immediatoly seized; when a voice cried, \"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he seIt himself grappled by one whose strenglh seomcd superhuman: determiried to sell his 1ife as dearly cls he could, he struggled; but it was in valn: he was llfted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his onemy threw himself upori him, and kneeling upon his breast, bad placed his hands upon his throat—when the glarc of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave ljght in the day, disturbed him;— hc instantly rose, and, leaving his prey,rushed through the door, and in amoment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through tbe wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now stil l; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light 0f their torches fcll upan the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. Al the dcsire of Aubrey they ſearched sor her who had attracted him by her crics; he was agajn Iefl in darkness; but what was his h0rror, when the light 0f the torches onoe more burst vpon hirn, to perceive theairy sorm of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a uision arising froin hjſ disturbed imaginatlon; but he again saw lhe saine forin, when he vnclosed them, stretched 6y his side. Tbere was no colovr upan her cheek, n0t oven upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her faco that seemed almost as attaching as lhe ljfe that onee dwelt there:—upon her neck and breasl was blood, and upon her throat were thc marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vclmpyre! a Vampyre!\" A litler was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid by the side of her who had lotely been ta him the object of so mariy brightand fairy visioris, now falleri wjth the flawer of lise lhat had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemod to sbun reflection, and take resuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciovsly in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different partjes who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentablecries, aſ they approached thc clty, forewarned the parents of some dreadful ccltastrophe. —To describe their grief w0uld be impossible; but when thcy ascerlained the causc of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolahle; both died broken-hcarted.\nAubrey bejng put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was 0ften delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable cambiriation he soemed to beg of his former companion to spclre the being he loved. At 0ther times he would imprecate maledietianſ upon his head, and curse him cls her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanccd at this tirne to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, vpon heclring of the state of Aubrey, immcdiately ploced himsolf in the same houſe, and 6ccame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from biſ delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now cambined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rulhvcn, by his kind words, implying almoft repentance far tho fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the atlerition, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconclled him to hls presence. His lordshjp seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared thot apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as biſ c0nvalesconce began t0 bc rapid, he again gradvally retjred into the fame state of mirid, and Aubrey perceived rio difference from the former inan, except lbat clt times he wassurprised to meet his gaze fixed lntently upon him, wlth a smjle of malicious exultation p1aying upon his lips: he knew not why, but lhis smile haunted him. During the laststage of the inval id's recovery, Lord Rvthven was appclrently engaged in watching the tldeless waves raiscd by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless suri;—indeed, he appeared to wish to av0id the eyes of a1l.\nAubrey's mind, by tbis shock, was much weakened, clnd thclt elasticity of spirit whicb had once so distinguisbed him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a l0ver of solitude arid ſilence as Lord Ruthven; but mueh as he wished for solltude, hls mind could not fjnd it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst tbe ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianlhe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her Ilght step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of tbe modest violet; then su ddenly turnirig rovnd, would show, ta his wild imogination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determjned lo fly ſcenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mjnd. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom be held himself bound by tho tender core he had taken of him during hls i1lriess, thclt thoy should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every ſpot to which a recollection oould be attached: but though they thus hasteried from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard mueh of robbers, but they gradually hegan to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention os individuols, whose interest it was lo excite tbe generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangors. Iri consequence of thus neglectlng the advice of the inhabitantf, on ane occasion they travelled with orily a few guards, morc to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whlch was lhe bed of a torrent, with lorge masses os rock brought dawri from the neighhouring precipices, they had reason to reperit thejr negligence; for scarcely wero the who1e of the parly erigaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of sevcral gvris. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing thcmselves behind rocks, had beguri to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthvon ond Auhrey, imitating lhejr example, retired for a momenl behind the shcItering turri of tbe defile: but ashamed of being lbuf detained by a foe, who with jnsulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposcd lo unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search 0f the eriemy. HardIy had they lost lhe shelter of lhe rock, when Lord Ruthven received cl shot in the shou1der, which broughl hiin to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assiſtance; and, na langer hceding tbe contest or his own pcril, was saon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces orou nd him—his guards havi ng, upon Lord Rulbven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises os great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he wos no more disturbed by their presence—tbey being cantent merely to guard the entrance tilI thelr comrado sbould retvrn with the promised sum, far which he had an orde r. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days morlifieation ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct ond appearance had not changcd; he seemed as unconscious 0s pain os hc had been of the objects about bim: bul t0wards the close of the last evening, his mind became clpparontly urieasy, arid his eyc aften sixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance witb more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you rnay save me—you may do more than thclt—I mean not my life, I hced the death of my existencc as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my horiour, your friend's horiour.\"—\"How? tell mohow? I would do any tbing,\" rcplied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my lifeehbs apace—I cannot explain thewhole—but if you would conceal all yov know os me, my hon0ur were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if iny death were unknawn for some time in England—I—I—but Iife.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swoar!\" crjed the dying man, raising himself with exullant violenee,\"Swear by all your ſoul revere s, by all yovr natvre fears, swear that, for a year and a day you wil1 not impart your kriowledge of my crimes or death to ariy living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatcvor you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bu rsting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey relired to rest, but did not sleep; lhe many circumftonces attending his acquajntance with this man roſe upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he reinembered his oath a cold shiuering came over him, as jf from the presentiinent of something horrible awaitirig him. Rlsing early in the marnirig, he was abaut to enter the hovel in whioh he had left thocorpfe, when a rabber met him, and irifarmed hlm that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by bimself and comrades, vpon his retiring,to the pinnaele of a neighbouring mount, according to a pr0mise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first c0ld ray of tbe moon lhat rose after his death. Avbroy astonished, and takirig several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the svmmit he found no trace 0f either the eorpse or the cl0thes, though the robberſ swore they pointed oul the identical rock on whicb they had lajd the body. For a time his mirid was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last retumed, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sclke of the clothes.\nWcary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortuneſ, and in which all apparently eanspired t0 beighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, clnd soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had wilh hiin belongjng to Lord Ruthuen. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weaporis of offerice, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the vlctim. There were several daggers and alagharis. Whilst turning thom over, and exarnining their ourious forms, what was hif furprise at finding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the ſame style as the dagger discovered in the fcltal hut—he shuddered—hastening ta gain further proof, be found the weapon, and his horror may bc imagiried when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held iri his harid. His eyes secmed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were conccrning the ladyhe had attempted to snatch from L0rd Ruthvcn's seductive arts. Her parents were in distrosſ, their fortune ruined, and she had not been hea rd of sincethe departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim t0 tbe destrayer of Ianthe. He b ecarne morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted iri ur ging the speod of thepostilions, asif he were going to save thc life of some onc he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a bree2e, whlch feemed obedient to his will, soon waftcd hiin to the English shores; and he hastened to tbe mansion of his fathors, and there, sor a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraccs ond cclresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she beforo, by her infaritine earesses, had gained his afsection, naw tbat the woman began to appcar, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of tbe drawing-roorn aſsemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists ln the heated atmasphere of a crowded apartment.Her 6lue eye was never 1it up by the levity af the mind beneath. Therewas a melancholy charm about it which did nat seem to arise from misforlvne, but from some feeling within, that appeared t0 indlcate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light sooting, which slrays where'er a butterfly or a colovr may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affcctiori, and would in her presence forget lhase griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for thal of the voIuptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only cighteen, and had not been presenled to the worId, it having boen thought by her guardians more fit thal her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her proteclor. It was now, tberefore, resolved that tbe next drawjng-r0om, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey wovld rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upori the melancholy which ovc-\nrpowered him. He could not seel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when bis mind hcld beon so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the ncxt day, which hcld been announced as a drawjrig-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, clnd all who were arixious to bask in tho smilc of royalty, haftenod thith-\ner. Aubrey was lhere with his sjsler. Whilo he was ftandirig in a corner by himself, hcedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance tbal the first time he had feen Lard Rvthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by tbe orm, and o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oclth.\" He had hard1y courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre thclt would hlast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had atlracted his notice on this spot up0n his first entry into society. He gazed till hislimbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he wos obliged to take lhe arm of a friend, andforcing a passage through the crowd, hc threw himself irito hif carriage, and was driven home. Ho paced the room with hurricd steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he wore afraid his thoughts were bursting from hjs brain. Lord Ruthveri agclin before him—circumstances st arted up in dreadsul array—tho dagger—his oath.—He raused hiinself, he could not beljeve it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagincltion had conjured up the image his mjnd was resting upon. Il was impossiblc tbat il oould 6e roal—he dotermiried, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthvon, the name hvng upon his lips, and he could riot succeed in gaining information. He went a few nlghts after with hiſ sister ta the clssembly of cl near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, clnd there gave himself up to his 0wn devovring lhoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were Ieaving, he roused himself, and entering onother room, found his sister surrounded by soveral, apparently in earnest conversation; he attemptod to pass and get near her, when one, whom be requested tomove, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, forced her towards tho street: at the door hesound hiinfelf impeded 6y tbe crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; and while hewas engaged jn passing tbern, he agaln heclrd that v0ice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"-\n—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his ſister, ſoon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed hy one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upari his thovghts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, arid it was in vain that she intreated him to exploin ta ber what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only ultered a few wordſ, arid those terrified hor. The more he thovght, the more he was bewildered. His 0ath slartled biin;—waf he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, a midst oIl be held dear, and not auert its progress? His uery sisler might havo been touched by him. But even if be were to break his oath, arid djscl0se his suspicions, who wouId believe him? Hethought of emp1oying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, hc remembered, had been already mocked. For days he reinained in this state; shut up in his roam, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughl him, for her sake, to support nclture. At last, no longer capable of bearing stj1lness and solitude, he left his hauſe, r0amed from street to street, anxious to fly that image wbich haunted him. His dress became neg1ected, and be wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun clf to the midnlghl damps. Hewas no longer to berecogni2ed; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to resl wherever fatigue 0vertook him. His sister, anxiouſ for his safety, employed people lo follow hiin; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. Hiſ conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with lhe idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend arnongst them, of whose presence they werc unconscious, he determined to enter clgain jnlo fociety,and wotch him cIosely, anxious to forewarn, in ſpite of hjs oath, all whom Lord Ruthven clpproached witb intimacy. Bul when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspioious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so visible, that his sisler was clt last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, sor her sake, a society which affectedhim so strongly. When, howcuer, remonstrance proved uriavailing, the guardians tbought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mjnd was becoming alienated, they thought it high tlme to resume again that trust which hod been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parerits.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he hod daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing bim from exposingto the gen era1 eye those marks of what lhey considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in lhe housc, and take constant care of him. He hardly appearod to notice it, so c0mpletoly was his mind abſorbed by one terrible su6ject. Hiſ ineoherence became cll last so greal, tbat he was canfined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapabIe of boing rous ed. He had became emaciated, his cyes had attaincd a glassy 1ustre;—the onlysign of affectjon and reeolleotion reinaining displayed itself upon tbe entry os his sister; then ho wovld sometjmes start, and, seizing her hands, with laoks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her riot to toucb him. \"Oh, do not touch him—lf your love for me is aught, do n0l go near him!\" When, howevcr, she inquired lo whom he referred, his onIy answer was, \"Trve! true!\" and againhe sank into a state, whonce not even fhe could rouse him. This lasted many monlhs: gradually, howeuer, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and hls mind threw off aportlon 0f its gloom, whilst his guardlans observed, that several times in thc day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tirne bad nearly elapsed, when, upon lhe last day of the year, ane of his guardians entering his room, began toconversc with his physician upon the melancholy circumſtance of Aubrey's bejng in so owfvl cl situotion, when his sister was going next day to 6e mclrried. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attraeled; ho asked anxiausly to whom. Glad of tbis mark of returning intellect, of which they seared he had been deprived, lhey inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a yovng Earl whom he had met with in fociety, Aubrey seomed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to seehis sister. They answered not, but in a few miriutes his sister waf with him. He was apparently again eapable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, arid klssed her cheek, wet with te ars, flawing at the thought os her brothor's being oncc more alive to the feellngs of affectian. He began to speak with al1 his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accoinplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lockel upon her broast; opening it, what was his surprise ot beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his lifc. He soized the portralt in a paroxysm af rage, and trainpled it under foot. Upan her afking him why he thus destroyed the resemblonce of her future husband, ho looked as if he did riot uriderstand her—tben seizing hor handſ, and gozing on her with a frantic expressionof cavntenanee, he bade her swear that she wauld never wed this mansler, for he— But hc cauld not advance—it seemed as if thal voice clgain bade bim remember his oath—he turned suddenly roun d, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him 6ul saw no ane. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thaught thjs was but a return of his disorder, entered,arid forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her t0 leavehim. He feIl upon his kriees to lhem, he implored, he bogged of them to de1ay but for one day. They, attribvting this to the insanity they imagined had tclken possession of hiſ mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retjred.\nLord Ruthven had called the moming after tbe drawing-room, and had been rofused with every one clse. When he heard of Avbrey's ill hoalth, he readily understood himself to be the cause os jt; but wben he learned that he was deemed irisane, his exultcltion and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those ornong whorn he had goiried thls information. He hastened to the bouse of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence af great affectian for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the oar of Mifs Avbrey. Who could resisl his power? His tongue had dangers and tails lo recount—could speak of bimseIf as 0f an lndividual having no sympathy with any bcing on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, siricc he knew her, his exjstence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation,if it were merely that he might lislen to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to vse the serpent's ort, or such was the wilI of fate, that he gained her affectlons. The title of lhe el der branch falling ot length to bim, hc oblained an important embassy, which served as cln excuse sor hastening the rnarriage, (in spite of her 6rothor's derangedstate,) which was t0 take place the very day besore bis departure for tbe continent.\nAubrey, when ho was left by the physician and hjs guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and papor; it was gjven him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjurlng her, as she valuod her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour af those now in tho grave, who once beld her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their bouse, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, onwhich he denounced the m0ſt heavy ourses. The servants promised they would deliver it; hut giving it to the phyſician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on withovt rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a h0rror that may more easily be conceived than describod, the notes of busy prepclration. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frclntic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame lbeir vigilance, they gradually st0le away, leaving him in the cvstody of an belpless old woman. Ho seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, arid in a moment found himself in the apartrnent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he lmmediately approached, and, taking hif arm by force, hurried him from the room, speecbless with roge. When on thc staircase, Lord Rut-\nhven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not rny bride to day, your sister is dishonourcd. Women are frajl!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused bythe old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, clnd he waſ conveyed to bed. This waſ not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marrjage was solemni2ed, and the bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAubrey's weakness increased; thc effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach os death. He dosired his sister's guardians migbt be callod, and when the midnight hour had struck, ho related composedly what the reader haf perused—he dicd immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Au6rey; hvt when they arriv-\n cd, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND 0F MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world waſ all before him, where to choose his place of rest,and Providence hls guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelclgo, on board one of his Majesly's vessels, in thc year1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the islond of that name. The beauty of thiſ place, and the certain svpply of eclttle and vegetoblef always to be had there, i nduee many British vesselſ to viſit it—botb men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather oul of the track for ships bound to Sinyrna, its b0unties amply repay f0r lhe deviation of a voyoge. We landed; as usucll, at the bottom of the 6ay, and whilst the mcri were employed in watering, and lhe purser bargclinjng for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other pIaces, where we had been before. Dn the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so nclmed) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who toId us he bad comc from Scio with an English lord, wha left the island four days prcvious to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said theGreek, \"and would have takeri mc with him; but I did not choofe to quit Mltylene, where I am likcly to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The coltage over the hill, facing the river, belongs t0 him, arid ho has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six huridred zochines for it, (about L250 Englisb currenoy,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the disferent islands.\"\nThis account excited aur curiosity very much, and we loft no time in hastening to tbe houfe where our countryman had residcd. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments ori the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting par lour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closct annexed. They were clll simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, alarge myrtle in the centre, clnd a smaIl fountain beneclth, which could be made to play through the branchcs by moving a spring fixed iri the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning poslure; a large couch or sofa completedthe furniture. In the hall stood half a dozcn English eane chclirs, and an empty book-case: lhere were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber hadmercly a large mattress spread an the floor, with two stusfed cotton qvilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-roorn wo observed a marble recoss, formerly, the old man told us, silled with books and papers, which were then in a large seamari's cbest in lhe closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts. On the tablot of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shclkspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmorman, in the Gerrnan language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's nove1s; Schiller's pIay of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; sevcral sma1l pamph1ets from the Greek press at Constantinople, mvcb lorn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written witha penoil, in Ilalian and Latin. Tbe Messiah was literally soribbled all 0ver, and inarked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old inan said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing withovt o rders, he would frown upon me for a week tagether; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking careof it, except twenty zechines which I poy to an agod Armenian who resides in cl small cottage in the wood, and wbom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nTho appeararice of the house externally was pleafing. Thc portioo in f ront was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted inarble pillars with black plinths clnd fret-work corriices, (as it is now customary in Grecian arcbitecture,) were considerably hjgher than tho roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone baluftrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpot, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are lhus furnished, as upon them the Grecks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christl,\" eating sruit, and enioyirig the evening breeze.\nOn the lefl hand as we entered the hovse, a small streamlel glided away, grapes, oranges and llmes were oIustering together on its horders, and under the shade os two large myrtle bushes, a mar6le seat with ari ornamentaI wooden back was placed, ori wbich we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'elock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was uery devout, \"orid always clttended our churoh twice a week, besides Suridays.\"\nThe view from tbis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, coverod with 0live ond myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an anoient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descerided in broken cascades, until it was lost in lhe woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horjzori unshadowed by a single clovd, terminates the view in front; and a litt1e on the left, thraugb a vista of lafty chesnut and palm-lrees, several small islands werc distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave wilh spots of emerald green. I soldom enjoycd a view rnore than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitIess as to the name of the person who hod reſided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said ourconductor, \"c0uld tcll, butI am sure be wllI not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, ald friend?\" said I—\"If I cari,\" saidhe, \"I dare not.\" We bad not time to uisit the Arinenian, but on our return ta tho lowri we learntseveral particulars of the isolated lor d. He had portioned eight young girlſ when he was lasl upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses lo olhers, and cotton and siIk to the girls who live by weauing these articles. He also baugbl a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamentſ to the poor children. In short, he clppeared to us, from aIl we collected, to have been a very eccentricand berievolent charclcter. One circumslance we learnt, which our old frjend at the cottage thought proper not to discl0se. He had a most beautisul daughler, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had baughl her a piano-forto, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information witb which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylerie; our iinaglnations all on the rclck, guesſing who this rambler in Greece could be. Ho hcld money it was evidenl: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geriius. Arrived at Palermo, alI our dou6ts were dispelled. Falling in company wjth Mr. FOSTER, tbe architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had 6een travellirig in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"abovt whom you are ſo anxiaus, is Lard Byrori; I mcl him in my travelf on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had ncver then heard af his l0rdship's fame, as we had been some years fr0m home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hclnds we recognized the recluse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret not having been moro curiaus jn our researcbes at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idoa of returnjng to Mitylerie on some future day; but to me that day wlll neuer returri. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good riame, whicb has been grossly sla ndcred. He has been described as of an unfceling dlspasjtion, averse to associating with human nature, or contrj6utlng in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to jts pleasvres. The fact ls direotly the roverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the sirier feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordsbip's poems, seein to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatby, and oharity appear to guide all his actions: clnd his courting tho repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religi0n hath set her ſeal, and overwhose hoad Beneuolence hath throwri her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasjng \"traitſ\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasvrcs, I do not assumea rlght ta glvc an opinion. Reports are ever to be reeeived with caution, particulorly when direoted against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where allmuſt appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is lhe surest testimony of a virtuous beart orid ſelf-approving conscierice.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-covrt, Fleet-street.",
    "clean": "Aubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this lale is fovnded is very gerieral iri the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be oommon: it did riot, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and il has on1y assumed its presentfarm sinoe the divlsion of thc Latin ond Greck chvrches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body eould not corrupt if 6urjed in their tcrritary, it graduaIly increased, and formed the subj ect of many wonderful ſtorles, still extant, of the dead rising from tbeir graues, and feeding upon the blood of tbe young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variotion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrairie, where thc belief exis ted, lhat vampyres nightIy imbibed a certain portion of the b1ood of thejr victims, who bccame emaci ated, lost their streng-\nth, and specdily died of consumpti0ns; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins beoame distended to sueh a state of repletion, as to ccluse tbe blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of thelr skinf.\nIn the Londori JournaI, of March, 1732, is o curious, and, of course, credible occount of a particular case af vclmpyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngary. It appears, that up0n an examination of the commarider-in-ehief and magistrates of the place, they poſitively and unaniinously affirmod, that, about sive years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been hcard to say, that, ot Cassovia, on the srontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had fovnd a way to rid bimself of lhe ovil, by eating some ofthe earth out of the vclmpyre's grave, clnd rubbing himselswjth his blood. This precaution, howevcr, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himse1f; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition waf made, that four persons had been deprived af life by his attacks. To prevent further misehief, the jnhabitarits having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and f0und it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free srom corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtalned, they resorted to the accuslomcd remedy. A stake was driven entlrely through the heart clnd body of Arnold Paul, at wbich he is reported to have cried ovt os dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut ofs bis head, burned his body, and threw thc ashes into his graue. The same measures were adopted with the corsef of lhose persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they sbould, in their turn, become agerits upan others who survived them.\nThe uniuersal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyro becomcs a uampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThismonstrous rodomontade is here relatcd, because it seems betler adapted to lllustrate the subject as the presont observations than any other inslance which could be adduccd. In many parts of Greece it iscansidered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime c0mmitted whilst lri exiſtence, that the deceased is not only doomed lo vampyrise, but compelled lo confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loued most whi1e upon earth—those to whom he was baund by tief of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBvt first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt thenative place, And suck the blood of all thy race; Therefrom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streclm of life; Yet loathe the bariquet whjch perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know lhedemon for lbeir sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that sor thy crime must soll, Tbe yovngest, best beloved of all,Shall bless thee with a father's name— That ward shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thov musl end thy task and mark Her cheek's last lingc—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must vicw Which freezes o'er its life1oss blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellowhair, Of which, in life cl lock when shorn Affection'ffondest pledge wclſ worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of tbine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then ſtalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sbrink awoy From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. S0uthoy has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalabo,\"tbe vampyre c0rse of the Arabianmaid Oneizo, who is represented as having rcturned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best l0vedwhilst in existenee. But this c annot be supposed to have resulted from the sjnfulness of her life, she belng pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type ofpurity and innoccncc. The voracious Tournefort glves a long account in his travels of several aftonishing caseſ of vampyrism, to whieh he pretendſ to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, bas pul sorth some learned dissertations, teridirig to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany ouriaus and inleresting notices on thif singular1y horrible superstition might be added; though the prefentmay sufflce for tbe limits os a riote, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with il, made use of in variovs parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, VardouIacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the mjdst os the dissipalions attendclnt upon a Lo ndon winler, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularlties, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirlh oround hiin, as if hc could not participatc therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracled his altention, that he mjght by a Iook quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thougbt1essriess reigned. Those who selt this sensation of awe, couldnot explain whence it arose: somo clttributed it to lhe dead grey eye, which, fixing upontbe object'f face, did not seem to penelrate, and at 0ne glance to pierce thr0ugh to the inward workingſ of the heart; but fell upon the check with o leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be irivited lo every hovse; a1l wished to see him, and those who had bcon accustorned to vjolent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleaſed at hauing somethlng in their presence capable of engaging their atterition. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, whlch riever gained a warmcr tint, either from the blufh of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, mclny of the female hunters after noloriety attempted to win his atlentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn iri drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw berself iri his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to atlract his notice:—though in vain:—when she ſtood before hlm, though his eyes were apparentIy sixed upon her's, stil1 it seemed as if they were unporceived;—even her unoppal1ed impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common aduItress oould not influence even the guidance af his eyes, it was n0t lhat the female sox was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent c aution with which be spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, tbclt few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He hcld, however, the reputation of a winnirig tongue; and whethcr it wcls that it even overcame the dread of his siriguIar character, or that thcy were moved 6y his apparent bcltred of vice, he was as often among those fema1es who form the boast of their sex from their domeslie virtues, as am0ng those who sully it by lheir vices.\nAbout the sclme time, there carne to London o young gentleman of tho name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possessjon of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardianf, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importanl charge of his mind to the care ofmeroenary subalterris, he cultivated more bis imagincltion than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic seeljng of honour and cand0ur, which dajly ruins s0 many milliners' apprcntices. He believed all lo sympathisc with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence mere1y for the picturesque esfect of the scene, as we see in romances: hc tboughl thclt the misery of a cottage merely consisled in the vosting of clothes, which were as warm, but which werc better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured palches. He lhought, in fine, that lho dreams of poets were the roalities of life. He was hondsome, fronk, and rich: sor these reaſ0nf, upon his enlering irito the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which sbovld describe with least trulh their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenancos when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his 1ips, soon led him into folse notjons of bis ta1ents and his merit. Attached as he waf t0 the romance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at findirig, that, except in the tallow and wax eandles that fliekered, not from lhe presonce of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in recl1 life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes,from which he had formed his study. Finding, however,sorne coinpenfalion in his gratjfied vanity, he was clbout to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in bis career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea as the character of a mcln entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other ſigns of hiſ observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by tho avoidance of their c0ntact: aIlowing his imaginotion to picture euery thing that flattered ils propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his sancy, rather than the person heforehim. He became acquaintod with hjm, paid him attenlions, and fo far advanced upori his notloe, that his prcsence waf a1ways rec0gnifed. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrafsed, and soon faund, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was abovt to travel. Desirous of gaining some inforination respecting thls singular character, who, lill now, had only wbetted his curiosity, he hintcd to his guardians, that it was time far him to perform the tou r, which for many generations has been thought neccssclry to enablethe young to lake some rapid steps in the caroer of vice towards putting themselvcs upon an equality with the aged, and not allawing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subiects of pleasantry or 0f praise, aecarding to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: ond Aubrey immediately mentloning bis intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to reccive from hirn a proposal to join him. FIattered by such a mark os esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in comm0ri with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity as studying Lord Ruthven'ſ character, and now he found, that, though many more of hiſ actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different eonclusioris from the apparent motives to his conducl. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, reccived from hls harid more than enough torelieve lheir immediate wants. But Aubrey could n0t av0id remarking, that it waf not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant cvenupon virtue, that he beſlowed his alrns;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneerſ; bvt when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him ta wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he waf sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporlunity of the viclous, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtu0us ind-\nigont. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found lhat thcro was a curse vpon it, for they were all either led to the ſcaffold, or sunkto the lowest and the most ahject misery.At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Avbrey was surprized at the apparent eagerneſs with wbich his c0mpanion sought for tho centres of all fashionable vjce; there he eritered into al1 tbe splrit of thc faro table: he betled, and always gambled with success, cxcept where the known sharper wos his antagonisl, and then he lost even rnore than he gained; but it was cllways with the same unchanging face, with which be goneral1y watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthfvl riovice, or the lucklesf fathcr of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed forturie's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire thanlhat os the cat whllst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, ho left the formcrly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, curfing, in the solitude of cl dungeon, the fate that hcld drawn him within the reach af this fiend; whilst many a father sat frclntie, amidsl the speaking looks of mute hungry chi1dren, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith lo buy even susficient to satisfy lhoir prcsent craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling tab1e; but immediately losl, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder be had just snatched from the coriuvlsive grasp of the innocent: this mighl but bethe result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienccd. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his fri-\nend, and beg him to resign thot charity and pleasure which proved tbe ruin of all, and did not tend to hls own profit;—but he delayod it—foreach day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openIy to him; however, tbiſ neuer occurred. Lord Ru thven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and ricb scenef of nature, wcls aIwaysthe same: his eye ſpake less than hjs lip; ond thovgh Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtaincd no greater gratification from it than the constant excltement of vain1y wishing to hreclk thal myslery, which to hiſ exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of somethlng superriatural.\nThoy soon arrjved at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left hjm in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Itallan c0untess, whilst be went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted eity. Wbilst he was thvs engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affectiori; theothers were frorn hif guardians, the latter ostonished him; if it had 6eforo entered irito his lmagjnation that there was an evil power residenl in his companion, these seemcd to giue him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediatcly leaving hiſ friend, and urged, that hjs character was dreadfully viciaus, for that the posse ssion of irresistible powcrs of seduction, rendered his liccntious habils more dclngerous to society. It had been difcovered, that his contempt f0r lhe adultrcss had not originated in hcltred of her character; but that he had required, to onhance his gratification, thal bif uictim, lhe partnor of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unfullied virlue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradatjon: in fine, that cllI those females whom he had sought, apparently on a ccount of their virtue, hod, since hls departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whoIe deforrnity of their vicos to lhe public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose characterhad not yet shown a single hright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved t0 invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, pvrposing, jn the mean while, to watch him moro closely, and ta let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He enlered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring lo work upon the jnexperionce of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly freqvented. In Ilaly, it is seldom that an urimarried semale is met with in socioty; he was thereforo abliged to carry on his plans insecrot; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discouered thal an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in tbe ruin of an inriocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered lhe apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly askedhim hiſ intenlions with rospect to tbe lady, informing him at the same time that hc was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that hls intentions weresuch as he supposed allwould have upon svch an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry ber, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; arid, jmmedicltely writing a note, to say, that from thal moment he must declirie accompanying his Lordsbip in the remainder of their proposed tour, he orderedhis seruant to seek other apclrtinents, and ealling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he know, not only with regard to her daughter, bvt also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assjgnatjon was preuenled. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify hls complcte assenl to a ſcporation; bvt did not hint any suspiciori of his p1ans having heen foiled hy Aubrey's iriterposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dlrectcd his steps towards Grecce, and crossing the Penirisula, soon found himself at Alhens. Hc then fixed his residence in the hovse of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upori monuments that opparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had biddon themselues benoath the sheltering soil 0r mony caloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful arid delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wlshing to pourtray on canvass lbe promised hope of the faithful iri Mahomet's parodise, save that her eyeſ spoke too mvch mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upori the plain, or tripped cllong the mountain's sjde, one wouldhave tbought the gazelle a p0or type of ber beautles; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animaI suited but t0 tho taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in hjs search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursult of a Kashmere butterfly, show tbe whole beauly of ber form, floating as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot lhe letters he had just decyphered upon an olmost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tressef falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, itmight well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from hjs mlnd tbe very object he had beforc thought of vita1 importanoe to the proper lnterpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all seeI, but none ccln appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling 6alls. Whilst he drew lhose remains of wbich he wished to prescrve cl memorial for his future hourf, she would stand by, and walch the magic effects of his pericil, ln tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hjm the ciroling dance upon the open plain, w0uld painl, to him in all tho glowing colourſ 0f youthful inemory, themarrlage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, tuming to subjects that had evidently madc a greater impresslon upon her mind, would tell hiin all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestriess and apparent belief of what she narraled, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as sho taldhim thetale of the living vampyre, who hcld pasfed years amidst his friends, and doarest tics, forced euery year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fernale lo pro1ong his exiſtence far the erisujng moriths, his blood would run oold, whilst he attempted t0 laugh her aut of such idle and horrible sclntasjeſ; bvt Ianthe clted to hiin the names ofold mcn, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several 0f their near re1atives and children hod been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it hcld been, remarked, that those who had dared to queftion their existence, alw ays had ſome proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbrcaking, taconfess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that thore could be no truth in her fears, tbough at the same time he wondered at the many c0incidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the svpernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her irinocence, so contrastod wjth all the affected virtues of the women among wh0m he had sought forhis vislonof romanco, won his heart; and while he ridiculed tbe idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an urieducated Greek girl, still he found himse1f more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear hiinse1f at times from hcr, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, delermined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found lt impossible to flx his attcntianupon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained on iinage that seemed alone tho rjghlfvl possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infaritile being he had first known. She a1ways scemed to part from him with reluctance; but jt was because she had no longer ariy one with whom she could visit her favouritc haunts, whilst herguardian was occupied in sketching or uncovcring some fragmont whioh had yet escoped tbe destructive hand of time. She had appealed lo her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed thejr existence, pale with horror al the very riame. Soon after, Avbrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, whjch waſ to detairi him for a sew hours; when they beard the name of the p1ace, they all at once hegged of hiin n0t to return at night, as he must necessarily paſs througb a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after tbe day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort 0f the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the inost hoavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross thelr path. Aubrey made light os their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but wberi he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of whicb apparently made their blood freeze, he was silcnt.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observc the melanc holy facc of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, moekirig the belief of lhose horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When be was clbout to depart, Ianthe come to the side 0f his horse, and earriestly bogged of hlm to retvrn, ere nigbt allowcd the power os these beirigſ to be put in aclion;—he pr0mised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did riot perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks whioh, in tbe warmer climates, so rapidly gother into a tremendous mass, and pour a1l thcir rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, howeuer, mounted his horse, deterinined t0 make up by speed for his delay: but il was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, iſ almost unkn0wri; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere hehad advanced far, the power of the storin was above—itf echoing thunders had scareely an intervol of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilsl the bIue forked lightning seemed to fclll and radiate al his very feet. Svddenly his horse to0k fright, and be was carried with dreadfvl rapidity through thc entangled foresl. The animal at last, thr0ugh fatiguc, stopped, and he found, by lhe g1are of lightning, thal he was in tho nejghbourhood of a hovel that hardlylifted itself up fram the masses of dead leaves and brvfhwood whicb surrounded it. Dismounting, he clpproached, hoping to find some onc to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he appraached, the thunders, for a moment filent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mjngling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced opcn the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. Hc was apparenlly unperceived; f0r, lhough he called, still the sounds coritinued, and no notice was taken 0f him. He found himself in coritactwith some one, whom he immediately seized; wben a volce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh sueceedcd; and be felt himself grappled by one whose ftrength seemed superhumari: determined to fell his life as dearly as he cou1d, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted fram his fcet and hurled with cnormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw bimself upon him, and krieelingupon bis breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torcbes penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, djsturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the d0ar, and ln a moment tbecrashing of the branchcs, as he broke through lhe wood, was no longer heard. The storrn was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon hoard by those without. They enlered; the light af their torches fell upon lhe mud walls, and the thatcb loaded on every individual straw with heavy flokes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; hc was again left in darkneſs; but what was his horror, whon the light of the torches oncc more burst upon him, to perceive thc airy form of his fair condvctrcss brought in a lifeless corse. He shul hiſ eyes, hoping that jt was but a vision arising from his disturbed imaginatian; but he again saw the same form, when he vnclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness clhout hcr face that seemed alrnost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon hor neck and breast was bloo d, and vpon her throat were the marksof teeth having opened lhe vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her wbo had lateIy been to him the object of ſo many bright and fairy visjons, now fallen with the flower af life that had died wilhin her. He knew not what his thaughts were—his mind was benvm6ed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vaoancy—hc held almost uncansciously in his hand a naked dagger af a parlicvlar coristruction, which had beon foundin the hut. They were soon rnet by different parties who had been engaged jn the fearch os her whom a m0ther had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approachcd the cily, forewarned the parents of some dreadsul cataslrophe. —To describe their grlef wovld be impossible; but when they asoertained the eause of their child's death, thoy looked ot Aubrey, and pointed to the corsc. Thoy were inconsolable; both died broken-hearled.\nAubrey being put to bed was sei2ed with a most uiolenl fever, and was often deliri0us; in these interva1s he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some uriaccountable combination he seemed to beg of hjs former companion to spa re thc being ho loved. At other times he would iinprecate maledicti0ns upon hjs head, ond curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ohanced at this time to arrive at Athons, and, from whatcver motiue, upan hearing of thestate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and hecame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the ſight of him whosc image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, impIying almost repentance for the fouIt tbat had cauſed their separation, and still rnore by the attention, anxiety, and care which he sbowed, so0n reconcilcd him to his presence. His lordship seemed qvite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being wbo had so aslonished Aubrey; but as soon as hls conualescence began to be rapid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived rio difserencc froin the formor man, excepl thatat times be was surprised to meot bis gaze fixed intently upon him, with a sinile 0f malicious exultatian playing upon bis lips: he knew not why, but this ſmile haunted him. During the last stage os the irivalid's recavery,Lord Ruthven was appare ntly engaged in wcltching the tideless waves raised by lhe coollng breeze, or in marking lbe progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the inoveless sun;—indeed, he oppeared ta wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroy's mirid, by this shock, was much weakened, and tbat eIasticity of spirit which had once so distingvifhed him now ſeemed to have sled for ever. He wclf now as much cl lover of soIitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it ln the neighbaurhood of Athens; if he sougbt it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Iarithe's form stood by hls side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of tbe modcst violet; then sudde-\nnly turning rovnd, would show, to his wild lrnagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined t0 fly scenef, every feature of which crea ted such bitter associatians in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom heheld himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during bjs illness, that they shovld visit those parts af Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled ln every direction, arid sought every spot to which a recollectiori could be attached:but thovgb they thus hastened from place to place, yet lhey seemed riot ta heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually bcgan to slight these reports, whicb they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest lt was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with on1y a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a dofenc e. Upon entering, however, clnarraw defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, wlth large inosses of rock brougbt down from the neigh6ouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for searcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whist1ing of bullets close totheir heads, ond by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant tbeir guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direclion whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating lheir example, retired for a in0ment behind tbe sheItering turn of the defile: bul ashamed of boing thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shouts bade them aduance, and being cxposed to unresisting slaughter, if clny of the r0bbers should climb above arid take them in the reor, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly hod they losl tbe ſhelter of lhe rock, when Lord Ruthven recejved a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubroy bastened to his assiftance; clnd, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was s0ori surprised by seeing the robbors' facesaround him—his guards having, upori Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their orms and ſurrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them t0 convey his wounded frierid to a neigh6ouring cabin; and having agreod upan a ransom, he waf no more difturbed by their presence—they being content mere1y to guard tbe entrance till theircomrade should rctum witb the promised sum, for whjch he hcld an order. Lord Rutbven'f ftrerigth rapidly decreased; in lwo days inortificationensued, and death seemed advancing withhosty steps. His conduct and appearance had nol changed; he seemed as vnconsclous of pcliri as he had been of thc objects obout him: but towards the cl0se of the last evening, his mirid became apparently uneasy, and hls cye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestnesf—\"Assjst me! you may save me—y0u may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the dca tb of iny exiſtence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save iny honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I nced but little—my Iife ebbs apace—I cannot explain lhe whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in tbe world's mouth—and is my death were unknown for somc time in England—I—I—bvt life.\"—\"It shalI not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raisirig hlmfelf witb exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all y0ur nature fears, swear that, for a yoar and a day you will not impart your knowledge of rny crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whalcver you may see. \"—His eyes fecmed bursting froin their sackets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he surik laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did nat sleep; the mariy circumstances attcnding his acqvaintance with this man rose upori his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came aver him, as if from the presentiment of somelhing horrible awaiting bim. Rising early jn the mornirig, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, whcn a robber met hiin, and informed him lhat it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hislordshjp, that it should be exposed lo the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrcy astonished, and taking several of the men, deterrnined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when be had mounted lo the summit he fourid no tracc af either the corpse or the clothes, though tbo robbers s wore lhey polnted out the identical rock on which they had laid lhe bady. For a time his mirid was 6ewildered in conjectures, but he at lasl relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of cl country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighlen that superstitious melancholy thathad seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himſelf in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case coritaining several weapons of offence, more or less adapted toensure the death of the uictim. Thcre were feueral daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining thcir curious forms, what waſ his surprise at finding a sheath apparently omamented in the same style as the dagger discove red in the fatal hut—hc shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered thot it sitted, thou gh peculiarly shaped, the shcath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were alsa drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquirief were c0ncernjng the lady he hadattempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvon'f seductive arts. Her parcnts were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since thc departureof his lordship. Aubrcy's mind became almoſt braken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this 1ady hod fallcn a victim to the destroyer af Ianthe. Hc beoame morose arid silent; and his only occupation oonsistedin urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some orie he held dear. He arrived al Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, s0on wafled bim to the Englisb shores; and he hostened to the mansion of his f athcrs, and there, for a moment, appearod to lose, in the embraces and carcfses of his sjsler, all memory of the post. If she before, by her infantinecaresses, hcld gained his affeclion, now tbat tho woman began to appear, she was ftill more attaohing as a c0mpanion.\nMiss Aubrey hcld not thal winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of thc drawing-room assemblies. There was none 0f that light brilliaricy which only exists in the hoated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy oharm aboul it which did not seem to arise from misfortunc, but from some fee1ing within, lhat appcared lo indicate a soul consciaus of a brighter realm. Her slep was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may altract—it was sedate and pcrislve. When alone, her face was never brjghtened by the smiIe of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and wovld in her prefence forget those griofs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smilc for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were then playlng in the light of their own natjve sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not heen prescnted to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentaliori should be delayed until her brother's return from the conti-\nnent, when he might bo her protect0r. Il was n0w, therefore, resolvcd thal the next drawing-rooin, which was fast approaching, fhould be the epoch of her entry into the\"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in tbe mansion af his fatbers, and fed upon lhe melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel inlerest about the frivolitles of fashianable strangers, wheri his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to saeri fice bis own comfort to the protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, ond prepared f0r lhe riexl day, which had 6een announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held sor along time, and all who were anxious ta bask in the smiIe of royalty, hastoned thilhor. Aubrey was there with bis sister. While he was slanding in a corner by himself, heedIess of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the firfl time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he rec0gnized loo well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember yovr 0alh.\"He had hordly courage to turn, searful of feeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a liltle distanco, the same figure whicb had attracted his notice on this spot upon bis first entry into society. He gazed til1 hif limbs almost refuslng to 6ear thelr weight, he was obliged lo take tho arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through thecrowd, he threw himsclf into his carriage, and was driven home. Ho paced the room with hurriod steps, and fixed hiſ hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts werc bursting srom his brain. Lord Ruthven agaln bcfore him—circumstances started vp in droadful array—the dagger—bis oclth.—He roused hims eIf, he could not helieve it poſsible—the dead rise agaln!—He thovghl his imagination had conjured up thc image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it couldbe rcal—he dotermined, therofore, to go again into society; for though he attemptedla ask cancerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he eould not sueceed in gaining information. Hc went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relati0n. Leaving her under the protectian of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, lhat many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering an0ther raom, found his sister surr0undod by sevoral, apparently in oarnest conversation; he attempted to pass clnd get near her, when ono, whom be requested to move, tumed round, and revealed to him those featuros he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried ſtep, farced hor tawards the street: al the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servclnts who were waitirig for their lords; clnd while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voico whisper close t0 him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nAu6rey becamo almost dislracted. If befare his mind had been clbsor6ed by onc subject, bow much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's llving agaln pressed upon his thoughts. His sisler'sattentions were now uriheedod, and it was in uoin that she intreated him to explain to her whal had caused hiſ clbrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and thofe terrified her.The more he thought, the more ho was bewildered. His oath startled hlm;—was he tben to allow thjs monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert jls progress? His very sister might have been touohed by him. But cven if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought os employing his own hand to free the world from such a wrelch; but death, he remembered, hod been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sisler came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nclture. At last, no longer oapable of bearirig stillness and s0litudc,he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to flytbal image which haunted him. His drcss become noglected, and he wandered, as ofton exposed to the noon-\n-day sun as to the midnight damps.He was no l0nger to be reoognized; at first he returned with the evening to lhe havse; but at laslhe laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sistcr, anxious for his safety, omployed people to folIow bim; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pvrsuer swiftcr tban any—from thought. His conducl, however, suddenly changed.Struck wilh the idea lhat he left by his abscnee the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose prefence they were uriconsci0us, he delermined to enter again into sooiety, ond watcb him cloſely, anxlous lo forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven appr0ached withintimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and svspicious looks were so slriking, his iriward shudderings so uisible, that his sister was at last abljged to beg of him to abstairi from seeking, for her sake, a society whlch affected him so strongly. Wheri, howevcr, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought propor to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whicb had been before impofed upon themby Aubrcy's parents.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, clnd af preveriting him from exposing to the general eye those markſ of what they c0nsidered folly, thcy engaged a physician to reside ln the house, ond lake constarit care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrlhle subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined lo his chamber. There be would often lje for days, irieapable of 6eing roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—lhe only sign of affoctiori and recollection remoiriing displayed ilself up0n the entry of his sister; then he wauld somelimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that se uere1y afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do nat touch hirn—if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Wben, howevcr, sbe iriquired to whom he referrod, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even shecould rouse hjm. This lostod mclny manths: gradually, bowever, as the year was passing, his incoherences became lesf frequent, and his mind threw off a portlon of its gloom, whiIst his guardians observed, that several tlmes in the day he wauld count upon his fingers a definito riumber, and then smile.\nThe tlme had nearly clapsed, when, upon the last day of the ycar, onc of hisguardians entering his room, began to converse with bis physician upon the melanchoIy circumstance of Aubrey's being iri so awful a siluation, when his sister was going next day to be marrjed. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he osked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had beeri deprlved, they mcntioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thlnking this was a young Earl whom he hadmet wjth in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still morc by his expressing hiſ intention to be presenl at the nuptiols, and desiring to see his sister. They ariswored not, but in a sew minutes his sistcr waf with him. He was apparently again capabIe of being affected 6y the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought os her brother's heing onco more alive tothe feelirigs of affectlon. He bogan to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguishod f0r rank and cvery accomplishment;when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, whal was his surprise at beholding lhe features of the monster wbo had fo long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rogc, and trampled il under foot. Upon hor asking him why he thus deslroyed the reseinblance of her future husband, he looked as is he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic oxpression of counlenclnce, he bade hor swear that she wovld never wed this monster, for be— But he could not advance—it seemed as if that voice ogain bade him re member his oath—he turned sudden1y round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but sclw n0 one. In the moantime the guardiclns and physioian, who had heclrd the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Mlss Aubrey, desired her to lcave hlm. He fell upon hif knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity tbcy imagined had taken possesfion 0s his mjnd, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning aster the drawing-room, and had boen refused with every one else. When he heclrd of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himſelf to be the cause of it; but when he leclrned that he was deemed inſane, his exultation and pleasuro could hardly be c0ncealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He bastened to the house of his former compariion, arid, by constarit atteridance, and the pretencc of great affcction for tbe hrother and interest in his fate, he gradually wori tbe ear of Misf Aubrey. Who could resist his p0wer? His tongue had dangers and toils lo recount—eould speak of himsclf as of an indjvidual having no sympalhy with any being on the crowdod earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;—could tell bow, since ho knew her, his existence, had bogun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might Iisten lo her sootbing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the ferpent'f art, or such was the will of fclle, that he gained her affections. Tbe title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an importanl embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged stale,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, whcn he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servarils, but in vain. He asked far pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a lelter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiriess, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grove, who once held her in lheir arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, ori which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought jt betler not to harass any inore the mind of Miss Aubrey by, wbat he considered, lhe ravings of a rnaniac. N ight passed on without rest to lhe busy inmatef of the houfe; and Aubrey heard, with a horror tbat may more easily be conceived than descri6ed, the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the ſound of earriages broke upori his ear. Aubrey grew almosl fraritic. The curiasity of the servants at last overeame tbeir vigilance, they gradually stole away, leauirig him in the custody of an helplcss old woman. He feized the opportunity, with orie bound was out os the room, and in a moment found himself iri the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approoched, and, taking his arm hy force, hurried him from the room, spcecbless wlth rage. When ori the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered iri his ear—\"Remeinbor your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sisler is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his atteridants, who, raused by lhe old woman, had comc in search of hirn. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage nat finding uent, had hrokeri a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed tohed. Thif was not mentioned to his sister, who was n0t present when be entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnjzcd, and the bride and bridegroam left London.\nAubrey's weakness lncreased; tho effusion of blood praduced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and wben thc midnight hour had struck, he relaled compofedly what the reader has perused—be died immedjately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, il was too late. Lord R vthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted lhe thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was alI before him, wbere to choose his place of rost, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Soiling tbrougb the Grecjan Arcbipelago, ori board one os his Majesty's vessels, in lhe yeclr 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, ln the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many Britisb vessels to visit it—6oth men os war arid merchantmen; and thovgh jl lies rather out of the track for ships bound lo Smyrno, its bounties amply repay for the deviation 0f a voyage. We landed; as vsual, at the bottom of tbe bay, and whi1st the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining sor cattle with the natlves, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave calIed Homer's Schoo1, and other places, where we had been before. Ori the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a yaung Greek as our gvide, who told us he had come froin Scio withan Englifh lord, who left the island four days prevlaus to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sald tho Greck, \"and would have taken me with hirn; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likoly to get mclrried. He was an odd, but a very good mclri. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an oId man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechinos for it, (about L250 Eng1ish currency,) and has resided there about fovrteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his fe1ucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis aceount excitedour curiosity uery rnuch, and we lost na time in hastening to tbe house wbere our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who canducted us over the mansion. It c0nsisted af four apartments on the gr0und-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitling parlour, clnd a bed-room, with a spacious closel annexed. They were all simply decoraled: plain green-stained waIls, marble tabIes on either side, a lclrge myrtle jn the centre, and a small fauntain beneath, which c0uld be made lo play through the branches bymoving a spring flxed in the sjde of a small 6ronze Venus in a leaning posture; a Iarge coueh or sofa completed thefumiture. In the hall stood half a dozen Eriglish cane chairs, and an emply book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchainber had mere1y o large maltr-\nesſ fpread on the sloor, with two stuffed cotlan quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room wo observed a marble recess, formerly, the ald man told us, filled with books and papers,which were then in a large seaman'schost in the closet: it was apen, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileav's, and Rousfeclu's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari languagc; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Itcllian edition, printed al Parina in 1810; severaI small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantiriople, mucb t om, but no English book of any description. Most of theso books were filled with marginol notes, written with a penciI, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to pIace them with theotbers; but,\" sajd he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he isso parti cular, that were I to move orie thing wilhout orders, he would frown upon me for a week togcther; he is othcrways very good. I onee did him a service; and I haue theproduce of this farm for tbe trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zeehines which I pay to an oged Armenian who resides in a small cottagc jn the woad, and wham the lord broughl here from Adrianople; I don't know for whot reasori.\"\nThe appear ance of thehouse externally was pleasing. The p0rtico in fronl was flfty paces long and sourteen broad, arid the flvled marble pil-\nlars with b1ack plinths arid fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architeoture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surraunded by a lighlstone ha1ustrade, wascoverod by a fine Tvrkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong c0arse lincn. Most of the hovse-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frult, and enjoying the evening breeze.\n0n the lcft hand as we enlered the bouse, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering logether on its horders, and under the shade of two large myrt1e bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placcd, 0n which we were told, lhe lord passed many of his ovenings and nights til1 twelve o'clock, rcading, writirig, and talking to himself. \"I supposo,\" said tbe old inan, \"prayjng\" for ho was verydevout, \"and always atlended our church twiee a woek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view srom this seot was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye vicw.\" A line of rich vineyards led tbe eye to Mourit Calc1a, couered with olive ond myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of whlch an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. Asmall stream issuing from the ruiris doscended in broken caſcades, uritil it was loſt in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon vnshadowed by a single clovd, terminates the view in fronl; and a little on the left, thr0ugh a vista of lofty chesnut and pcllm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observod, studding the light blue wave wilh spots of emerclld green. I seldom enjoyed o view more than I did tbiſ; but our enquiries were fruitless aſ to the name of the person who had resided in this romaritic solitvde: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candicl. \"The Armeriian,\" said our eonductor, \"cou1d tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare nat.\" We had not time to viſit the Armenjan, but on our retum to the town we learnt severa1 particulars of thc isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was laſt upon the island, ondeven danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one inan, horses to others, arid cotton and silk lo the girls who live by weaving these artioles. He also boughl a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we collected, to bave been a very eccentric and benevolent choracter. Onc circumstance we learnt, which ovr ald friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautifu1 daughter, with whom the lard was oflen seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piana-forte, and taught her himself thc vse of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imagjnations all on the rack, guessing wbo this rambler in Greece covld be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and aIl those eccentricities which mark peculjar genjus. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts wcre dlspel1ed. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a pvpil of WYATT'S, who had hecn travellirig in Egypt and Greecc, \"The individual,\" sajd he, \"aboul whom yov are so anxiaus, if Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island os Tericdos, and I alfo visited him at Milylene.\" We had never then heard of hif lordship's fame, as we bad been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we rccognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret riot having been more euriaus in 0ur researches at the cottage, bvt we cansoled ourselvef with the idccl of returnirig to Mitylene ori somc suture day; but to me that day will never return. I make this slatemenl, belleving il riot quite uninteresting, and in ju stice to his lordship's good narne, which has been grossly slandered. He has been descri-\nbed as of an unseeIing dispoſition, clverse to associaling with human nature, or contributing iri any way to sooth its sorrowſ, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered froin these little anecdotes. All the finer foe1irigs of the heart, so elegantly depicted jn his lordship's poems, secm lo have their seat in his bosom. Teriderness, sympathy, and charity appear to gvide allhis actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additiancll reason for marking him as a beirig on whose heort Religion hath set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantIe. Na man can reod the preceding pleasing \"traits\" wit-\nhout feeling proud of hjm aſ a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleosurof, I do riot assume a right to give an opiniori. Reporls are ever to be received with oaution, parlicularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares juſtify himself before thal awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lard Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is lhe surest tostimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-e0urt, Fleet-street.",
    "clean": "Aubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered."

    "ocr": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tole.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general iri tho East. Amang the Ara6ians it appears to be common: it did riot, however, extend itself lo the Greeks until clfter the establishrnent ofChristianity; and it has 0nly assumed its preserit form since the djvision of the Latin and Greek churches; at which timc, the idea bocoming prevalent, that a Latin body cauld riot corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradual1y incroased, and formed thc subject of mony wonderful stories, still extant, of lhe dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the 6lood of the young and beautiful. In the Weſt it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyref nightly imbibed a certain portiori 0f the blood of their victims, who became emaclaled, lost their strength, and speedily died of consvmptions; wbilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and thoir ueins hecame distended to such a state of replolion, as to cause the blood to flow from a1l the passages of their bodles, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible acoount of a parliculor cclse of vampyrism, which is ſtated to have occurred clt Madrcyga, in Hungary. It appcars, thal upon an examination of tbe coinmander-in-chief and magistrates of the plaoe, they posilively and unariimously affirmed, that, about fivc years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, had been heard to say, thal, at Cassovia, on the srontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented hy a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself os the evil, by eating some of the earth ovt of the vampyre's grave, and rub6ing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevenl him srom bec0ming a vampyre hiinself; for,about twenty or thlrty days after bif death and burial, many pers0ns cornplained of having been tormented by him,and a deposition was made, tbat four persons had been deprived of life by hif attocks. To preverit furthcr mischiof, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, ond found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of uampyrism) fresb, and entirely free from corruplion, and emitting clt the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Praof having been thus obtained, they resorted lo the accustomed romedy. A stakc was drivenentirely through tho hoart and body of Arnold Paul, atwhich he is roported to have cricd out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and tbrew the ashes into his grave. The same measvres were adopted with the corses of those persans who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in tbeir turn, become agents upon others who survived lhem.\nThe unjversal belief is, that a person fucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himse lf, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrouf rodomantade is bere related, because it seems hetter adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations thari any other instance wbich could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as cl sort 0f punishmenl after dealh, for ſome heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrlse, but compelIed to confine his infornal visitations solely lo lhose beings he loved inost while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of k indred and affcction.—A supposition alludod to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, os Vampyresent, Thy oorse shallsrom its tomb be rent; Then gha stly haunt tbe na tive placo, Arid suek the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain theftream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perf0rce Must feed thy ljvid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yct expire, Shall kn0w the de mori for thcir sire; As curſing thee, thou cvrsing them, Thy flowers are withered on tbe stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shal1 hlcss thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart iri flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her check's last tjnge—her eye'slast spark, And the last g1assy glance musl view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then wilh unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, ln life a lock when shom Asfcction's fondest pledge was worn— But now if borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet wilh thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard Iip; Then stalking to thy ſullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Asrjtsraue, Till theso in horror ſbrink away From spectre more cleoursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey has also introduced in his wild bul beautiful poern of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having retumcd from the grave f0r the purpose of lormonting bim she best loved whilst in exiſtence. But lhis cannot be supposed to bave resultod from tbe sinfulness of ber life, she being pourtrayed throughout lhe whole of the talo as cl complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciaus Toumefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonisbing cases os vampyrism, to whieh he pretends to havc been on eyewitness; and Ccllmet, in his great work upon this svbject, bcsides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionclry narralives illustralive of ils effects, has put sorth saine learnod disserlations, tending lo prove it to be a clclssical, as wcll as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible fuperstition might be added; though the present may suffioe for tbe limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by mercly remarking, thclt though the tcrm Vampyrc is the one in most general acceptation, there ore several others synonymous with it, inade use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeried that in the mjdst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, therc appeared al the vario us partics of the loadcrs of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than hiſ rank. Ho gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participale therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell lt, and throw fear jnto those b reasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation os awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance l0 pierce through to the inward workingſ of the heart; but fell upon the cbeek with a leaden ray lhat wejghed upon the skln it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished tosee him, and those who hadbeen accustomed t0 violent ex citement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging tbeir attention. In spite of tbe deadly hue of hiſ face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong em olionof passion, though its forrn and oulline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, somc marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dresf 0f a mountebank, to attract his notice:—thougb in vain:—whcn she sto od before him, thavgh his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffIed, ond she left the field. But though the common adultress could not insluence evon tho guidance of his eyes, it waſ riot that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet such was the apparcnt caution with which he spoke to the virluous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addreſsed himself ta females. He had, however, thc reputation of a wirining tongue; and whetber it was tbal it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moued by his apparent batred of vice, he was as often amorig thosc females who form tbe b0ast of their sex from thelr domestic virtues, asamong thoſe who sully it by tbeir vicos.\nAhout the same time, there came to London a young gentloman of tho naine of Aubrey: be was an orphan left wlth an 0nly sister in the p0ssession of great wealtb, by parents who died while he was yet in childhaod. Left alsa to hjmself 6y guardians, who thought it thejr duty rnerely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the cclro os mcrcenary subalterns, he cultivated more his lmagination thon hjs judgmonl. He had, hence, tbat high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliriers' apprentioes. He believed all to sympathise wilh virtue, and thoughl that vice was thrown in by Providencc merely for thc picturesque effcct of the seene, as we see in romancef: he thought that tbe misery 0f a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warin, but which wero better adapted t0 the paintcr'seye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in f ine, that the dreams of poets were the realilies of life. Hc was handsome, frclnk, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many motherf surrovnded him, striving which sbould describe with leost truth their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenanoef when he approclched, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lod him into false notions of his talerits and bis merit. Attached as he was to the romanco of bis solitary hourſ, he was startled al finding, that, except in the lallow and wax eandles that flickered, not from the p resence of a ghost, but from warit os snufflng, there was no foundation in reol life for any of that congeries of pIeasing piclures and descriplions c0ntained in those vol umes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensatiori in his gratified vanity, hewas obout to re1iriquish his dreclms, when the extraordinary being we have ab0ve defcribed, crossed him in his oareer.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibilily of forming an idea of tbe charaoter of a man entirely absorbed iri bimself, who gave few olber signs of his obseruation of external ohjects, than tho tacit assent to their exiſtence, implied by the avoidarice of their contact: allowing bis imagination to pioture every lhing that flattered itf propensity lo extravagant ideaſ, he soon formed this object inla the hero of a romarice, ond determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, ra ther than the person bcfore him. He became acquointed wjth him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his nolice, that his presenoe was always recognised. He gradualIy lcarnt that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrasſed, and soon sound, from the notes of preparation in — Street, thal he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining somc information rospecting this singular character, who, till naw, had only whetted hls curiosity, he hinted to his guardions, that it was time for him to porform the tovr, which for rnany generations hasbeen thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid stepf in the career of vicc towards putting themselvesupon an equality with the aged, and riot allowing them toappear as if fallen from the skief, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, acoordirig to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning his inlentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to rec eive from him a proposal to join hlm. Flattcred by suoh a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, be gIadly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no 0pportunjtyof studying Lord Ruthven'ſ character, and now he fovnd, that, though many more of hls actions were exposed to his view, the resvlts offered different conclusions from the opparent molives to his conduct. His eompanion was profusc in his 1iberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from hiſ hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortvnes attendant oven vpon virtue, that ho bestowed hlſ alms;—these were sent srom the doorwith hardly ſuppressed sneers; but when the pr0fligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in his lvst, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, ottributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Tbere was orie circumstance about the charjty of his Lordship, which was ftill more impressed upon his mind:al1 thase upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that lhere was a curse upon il, for they were all either led to the seasfold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other lowrif thraugh which they passed, Aubrey was surprjzed at the apparent eclgerness wjth which his companion sought for the centres of oll fashionable vice;thero heentered into all the spirit of the faro table: ho betted, and always gambled witb succesf, except where the knowri sharper was hjs antagonist, and theri he lost even more than he gained; but it was always wilh the same urichanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encouritered the rasb youthful novice, or the luckless falher of a numerous fami1y; then his very wish secined fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness af mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the eot wbilst dalIying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the former1y affluent youth, lorn from the circle ho adomed, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate thal had drawn him within the reach of this fjerid; whilst many o father sat frantic, amidſt the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a singlefarthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even susficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet be took no money from the gambling table; bvt jmrnediately lost, to the rviner of rnany, lhe last gilder he had juſt snatched from the eonvulsiue grasp ofthe innocent: this might but bc the result of a certain dogree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable as combating lhe cunning of the more experiericed. Aubrey osten wishod to reprcsent this to his friend, and bog him to reslgn thol charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his awn profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his frierid would give hlm some appartunity of speaking frankly and operily to him; however, this never occurre d. Lord Ruthven ln his carriage, and amidst lhe various wiId and rich scencs of nalure, waſ always the fame: his oye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was neclr the object of his curiosity, heobtajned na greator gratification from it than the constant excitement of uainly wishing to break lhclt mystery, whlch to his exalted imagination began to assumc the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey ſoon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time 1ost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendclnce upon the morning clrcle of an Italian countess, whilsl he went in search of the momorials of anather almost deserted city. Whllst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, whicb he opened with eagcr impaticnce; the first was from bis sister, breathing nothing bvt affcction; tbe others were srom his guordians, tbe lalter aſtonished him; if it had befare entered inlo his imagiriation that tbere was an cvil power refident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason sor the bellef. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, arid vrged, that his character was dreadfulIy vicious, for that the passession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangorous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; bul that he had required, to erihance his gralification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from tbe pinnacle of unsullied virtuo, down to the loweſt abyss of infamy and degradation: jn fine, thot all thoſe femaleſ whomhe had sougbt, apparently onaccount of their vlrtue, bad, since his departure, thrown even lhe mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of t heir vices to tbe publicgaze.\nAubrey determined upon leoving one, whofe character had not yct shown a single bright point on which to rest tbe eye. He resolved to lnvent some plausible pretext for abandoriing him altogether, purpofing, in the mecln while, to watch bim more closely, ond lo let no slight circurnstanccs pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperierice of the daughter of the lady whosc house he chlefly frequented. In Italy, it ls soldom that an unmarried female is met with in soclety; hc was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; 6ut Aubroy's cye sollowed bim in all his windings, and soon discove red that an clssigna lion had been appointed, which would most llkely end in the ruin of an innocerit, lhough thoughtless girl. Losjng no time, he cntered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his interitions with respect to tbe lady, informing him at the same time that he waſ aware 0f his being about to meet her lhatvery nlght. Lord Rvthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would haue upon such an occasion; and upon bejng pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Auhrey retired; and, immedi ateIy writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remain der of their proposed t0ur, he orderod his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not 0nly with regard to hor daughter, bul also concerning the character of hls Lordship. The assignation wasprevented. Lord Ruthvon next day morely sent hls servant to notify hiscomplete asſent to a separation; but did not hlnt any ſuspicion of his plans having been foiled hy Aubrey's interpoſilion.\nHaving lcft Rorne, Aubrey dlrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing tho Peninsula, saon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his resjdence in the hovse of a Greek; and soon oceupied hjmseIf in lracing tbe faded recards of aneient glory upon manuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden theinselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured llchen. Under the same roof as himself, oxisted a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model sor o paintor wishing to pourlray on cclnvass tho promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think ſhe could belorig to th0se wh0 had no souls. As she daneed upon the plain, 0r tripped along lhe mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typc of her beautieſ; for who would bave excbanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated riature, for that sleepy luxurious laok of the aniinal suited but to the tasle of an epicure. The light step of Iarithe osten accompanied Aubrey in hls search after antiquities, arid oftcn would the uneonscious girl, engagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere hutterfly, sbow lhe whole beauty of her form,sloalirig as itwere upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the lettcrs he had just decyphered upon an almost esfaced tablet, in tbe contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as sbe flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray sucb delicately brilliant and swiflly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the aritiquary, who let cscape from his injnd the very object he had before thougbt of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passclge in Paufan-\nias. Bul why attempt to describe charms which all feel, bvt none can clppreciate?—It was innoccnce, youth, and beauty,unaffected by erowded drawing-rooms arid stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for hls fulure hours, she wovld stand by, and watcb the magic effects of his pencil, in tracjng the scenes of her native place; she w0uld then desc ribe to hjm the eircling dance upon lhe open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colourf of youthful memory, the morriage pomp she remembered viewing in her irifancy; arid then, turning to subjects that had evidently mode a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all tbe supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narroted, excited the iriterest even of Aubrey; and often os she told him the lale of thc living vampyre, who had passed years amldst his friends, and dearesl lies, sorced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femclle to prolong his existence for the ensving months, bis blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrlble fantasies; but Ianthe cited t0 him the names of old men, who had at lclst detected one living ainorig lhemselves, after severa1 of their near re latives and children had 6een found marked with the stomp of the fiend's appelite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had ſome proof giveri, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was truc. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of those monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthuen; he, bowcver, still pcrsifled in persuading her, that there could be no trvth jn her fears, thovgh at the same time he wondered al the many coincidences whicb had olI lended to excite a belief in lhe supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself moro and more to Ianthe; her lnnocerice, so contrasted withall the affected virtues os the womcn omong whom he bad fougbt for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habjts, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himsclf more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ol times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquaricln research, be would depart, determined not to return until his objeot was attajned; but he always found it lmpossible to six his attention upon the ruins arovnd hirn, wbi1st ln his mind horetained an image that soemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of hif love, and was ever the same frank infantile boing he had first known. She always seomed to part srom him with reluctance; bvt it was bccause she had no longer any one wjlh whom shc cauld visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealod to her parerits on the fubject os Vainpyref, and they both, with seuercll present, affirmod their existence, pale with horror at tbe very name. Soon after, Aubrey determiried to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, lhey all at once begged of him not ta return at riight, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, whero no Greek wovld ever remain, after the dayhad closed, upon any consideration. They described it clſ the rcsort of the vampyres in tbeir nocturnal orgies, and denounced the moft heavy evils as impending upon him who dored to cross their path. Aub rey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh thcm out of the idea; but when he sclw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a fuperjor, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made lheir blood freeze, be was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned ta find that his words, mocking the belief af those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When be was aboul to depart, Ianthe came to lhe side of his horse, and eamestly bcgged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of lhese beings to be pul in action;—he promised. He was, however,so occupied in his resoarch, that he did not per-\nceive that d ay-light would soan end, and tbat iri the horizon there was one of th0se ſpecks which, in the warrner climates, so rapidly gather into a tremeridous mass, and pour all their rage upon the dovoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was t0o late. Twilight, in these ſouthern climates, is almo sl unknown; immedjately the sun sets, nighl beginf: and ere he bad advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its eoh0ing thunders had scarcely aninterval os rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightnirig seemed lo foll and radiate ot his very feet. Suddenly hjs h0rse took fright, and he was earried with dreadsul rapldity through the entangled forest. Tbe animal ot last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightnirig, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel lhot hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead Ieaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismovriting, he approached, hoping to findsome one to gvide him to the tawn, or at least trusting to obtain sheltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thvnders, for a moment silent, alIowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with thc stifled, exu-\nltant mockery of a laugh, contiriued in one aImoft unbrokcn sound;—he was startled: hut, roused by tbe thunder whicb again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: lhe sovnd, however, gujded him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still tbe sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himsclf in contacl with some one, whom heimmediate1y seized; when a voice cried, \"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by orie whoso strenglh seemed superhumcln: determined to sell his life as dearly as be could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he waf lifted froin his feel and hurled with enormous for ce against the ground:—his enemy threw himseIf upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed bis hands vpon his throat—when the glare of many torches perietrating througb the hole lhat gave light in the day, difturbed him;—he instantly r0se, and, leaving his prey, rushed thr0ugh the door, and in a m0ment the crashirig of lhe branches, os he broke through the wo0d, was no longer beard. The ftorm was now still; and Aubroy, incapable of moving, was soon heard by th0se without. They entered;the light of their tarches fell upon the mud wa1ls, and the thalch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire 0f Aubrcy they searched for her who hadattracted him by her cries; he was again lefl in darkncss; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once rnore burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a Iifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping thclt it was bul a vision arising from his disturbed imaglncltion; but he again saw the same form, when be uriclosed them, stretched by his sjde. There was no colovr upon her cheok, not even upon bor lip; yet there was a stlllnoss about her face that seemed cllmost af attaching as the lifc that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and broast waf hlood, clnd upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vclmpyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the sjde as her wbo had 1ateIy been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now sclllen with the flower of life that had died within ber. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to fhun reflection, and take refuge in vaconcy—he held almost unc onsciously in bis hand a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, which bad been found in thc hut. They wore soon met by differcnt parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lameritable cries, as lhey approached the city, forewarned the parents of soine drcadful catclſtrophe. —To describe lheir grief would be jmpossible; but when they ascertclined the cause of their child'f death, tbey looked at Aubrcy, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolab1e; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized witha m0st violent fever, and was osten deliriovs; in these intervalſ he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by ſome unaccountab1e combinatiori he seemed to bcg of bls former componion lo spare tbe being he Ioved. At other limes he would imprecate mclledictions upon his head, and curse bim as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, cbanced at thjs time to arrive at Athcns, and, from whatever motlvc, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placedhimself inthe same bousc, and became his conſtant atlendant. When the latter recovered srom bis delirium, he was horrlflod and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that os a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hjs kind words, irnplying olmost repentance for the sault thot bad causod their separation, and still more by the cltt enti0n, anxiely, and care which he showed, soon reconcilod him to his presenco. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that clpathetic being who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalesccnce began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state ofmind, and Aubrey perceiued no difserence frorn the former man, except that clt times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of molicious exultation pIaying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng the 1ast ftage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was opparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by thc cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circlirig, like our world, the movelefs sun;—indeod, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this sbock, was much weakened, and that e1astioity of spirit which had once ſo distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but muoh as hc wished for solitude, his mind covld not find it in the neigbbovrhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst tho ruins be had formerly frequentod, Ianthe's f0rm ſtood by hjs side—if he sovghl it jn the woods, her lighl step w0uId appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, t0 his wiId imagination, her pale sace and wounded throat, with a rneek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly ſcenes, every fcaturo of whjeh created such bitter ossociations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender carc he had taken of bim during his i1lnesf, thal they should visit those parts 0f Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direclion, and sought every spot to which a recollectjon could be attached: but though lhey thus hastened from place to placc, yet they seemed nol to heed what they gazed up0n. They he ard much of robbers, hut they gradual1y began to slight these repor ts, which they imagiried were only the inverition of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosjty of those whom they de fended from pretended dangcrs. In consequence of thvs neglecting the advice of lhe inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, m0re to serve as guides thari as a defcnce. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, witb large masses of rock brought down from tho neighbovring precipices, they had reasori to repent lheir negIigence; sor scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narraw pafs, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed rcport of several guns. In ari instant their guclrds had left them, and, placing themselves 6ehind rocks, had begun to fire in the direclion whence the report cclme. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sbeItcring turn of the defile: but ashamed af being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts badc them advonce, and being exposed to uriresisting slaughter,if any of the robbers should climb obove arid take tbem in the rear, they determined at once t0 rush farward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of thc rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in thc shoulder, which brought him lo the groun d. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer boeding lhe conlest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing tbe robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrondered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon iriduced them to convey his woundedfriend to a neighbovring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being conlent merely to guard the entranco till their comrade sh0uld return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificatjon ensued, and deoth seemed advancing witb hasty steps. Hisconduct and appearance had not changod; he seemed as unconscious of pain cls he had been of thc objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mirid became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced ta affer his assistance with morc than vſual earnestness—\"Assist me! you mcly save me—you may do more than that—I mean riot my life, I heed the death of rny exjstence as liltle as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" repljed Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if yov would conceal all you know of me, rny honour were free from stain in the world's rnoulh—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Sweclr!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by al1 your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowIedge of my crirnes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—Hiſ eyes seomed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hiſ pll1ow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did nol sleep; lhe many circumstances attending his acquairitance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering eame over him, as if from the presentimenl of something horriblo awaiting him. Rifirig early in the morriing, he was aboul to eriter the hovel in which he had left thc corpse, when a robbor met blm, and informed him that it was no longer there, havirigbeen conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a rieighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hislordship, that it shouId be exposed to the first cold ray of thc moon that rose after bif death. Aubrey astoriished, clnd taking several of the men, determined to go clnd bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he bad rnounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the olothes, though the robbers sw ore lhey pointed out the identical rockon which they had laid the body. For cl timehis mind was bewlldered in conjecturcs, but he at last returned, canvinced that thoy had burjed the corpse for the sake os the clothes.\nWeary of a couritry in which he had mot with sueb terrible misforturies, and in whieh a1l apparenlly conspired to heighten that superstitious meIancholy that had seized upon his mind, hc rosolved to leove it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While wcliting for a vessel to convey him lo Otrant0, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he hcld with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other tbings there was a case containing seve ral woapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were s everal daggers arid ataghans. Whilst turnlng them over,and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at firiding a fheath apparentIy omarnentod in the same style as the dagger discovered in the falal hut—be shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may 6e imagined whcn hc discovered that lt fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he hold in his hand. His eyes seemed ta need no furtber certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished t0 disbe1ieve; but the partieular form, tbe same varying tints upon the haft and sbeath were alike in splendour on botb, and left no room for d0ubt; there were also drops 0f blood on each.\nHe lefl Sm yrna, and on his way bome, ot Rome, his first inquiries were concerning lhe lady ho had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distreſs, their fortune ruinod, and she had not been heard of since the deporture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind beoame almost broken under so many repeated horrors; hc waſ afraid thal this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation c0nsiſtedin urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going t0 save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a bree2e, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to tbc English shores; and he hastened to the mansjon of his fathcrs, and there, for a moment, appearod to lose, in the embr aces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she bcfore,by her infanline caresses, bcld gained his affoction, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey had nol that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause 0f the drawirig-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliclncy which onIy exists in tbe heated atmospbere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was riever lit vp by the levity of lhe rnind beneath. There was a melanch oly charm about it which did not seem lo arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, whioh strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened hy the smile of joy; but when her hro-\nther breathed ta her his affection, and would in her prefence forgot those griefs sbe knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for thal of the volupluclry? It seemed as if th0se eyes,—lhat face were then playirig in the light of lheir own nalive sphere. She was yet orily eightcen, and had not been presenled to the world, it havjng been thought by her guardianf more fit thot her prescntation ſhould be delayed until her brother's relurn from the contlnent, when he might beher proteotor. It was now, therefore, resolued that the next drawlng-room, which was fast approachirig, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy sceno.\" Aubrey would rather bave rernained ln themansion of bis fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest ahout the frivolities of foshionable strangers, when his mind hcld been fo lorn by the cvents he had witnessed; but he determined lo sacrifice his own comforl to tho protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawlng-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—adrawing-ro0m had not beori held for a long lime, clnd all who were anxious to bask in the smile os royalty, hastened thither. A ubrey was there with hiſ sister. While he was stariding in o corrier hy himself, beedlefs of all around him, erigaged in tbe remombrance that the first tjme he had feen Lord Ruthuen was iri that very place—he felt himself suddenly feized by the clrm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remernber your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearfu1 of seeing a spoctre lhat would blast him, wheri he poreoived, at a little dlstance, the same figvre which bad attracted hif notice on this spot upon his first entry into sociely. He ga zed till hiſ limbs almost refuslng t0 bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage throvgh thc crowd, he threw himself irito bis carriage, and was driuen home. He paced the room with hurrjed steps, andfixcd his hands upon his head, as if ho were afraid his tboughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven agoin before him—circumstances startod up in dreadfuI array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himsclf, he could not beliove it possible—the dead rise again!—Ho thought bis imagination had conjured up lhe image his mlnd was restjng upon. It was jmposslb1e that it covld be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into socioty; for lhough he attempted to ask concerning L0rd Ruthven, tho name hung up0n hif lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights ofter with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himsels up to his own devouring tbaughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused hjmself, and entering anolher room, faund his sister surrounded by several, appareritly in eamest convorsation; he attempted to pass arid get near her, when ane, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveaIed to hlm those features he mast abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with burried step, forced her towards tbe street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wajting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passlng them, he again heard that v0ice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oat-\nh!\"—He did not dare to turn,but, hurrying his sister, soon rcached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If besore his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more coinpletely was jt engrossed, now lbat the ccrtointy of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughls. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to exp1ain to her what had caused his abrvpt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he thaught, the more he was bewildered. His oath ftartled him;—was he then to allow this monsler to roam, bearing ruin upori his bre-\nath, amidst all he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His very ſister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose hif suspicians, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to frce the wor1d from fuch a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. F0r days he remained ln tbis stato; shut up in his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when hiſ sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, far her sake, to support nature. At last, rio longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from stroet to street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often expoſed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight domps. He was no loriger to be recognized; at first he rcturned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook hirn. His sister, anxious for his safety, emplayed people to sollow him; but they were soon distanced by hirn who fled from a pursuer swifter than ony—from th0ught. His can duct, however, su ddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he lofl by his abſence lhe wholo of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of wh0se preſence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxiouſ ta forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intim acy. But when he entered into a roorn, hlshaggard and suspicious looks wore so striking, his inward shudderings sa visible, that his sister was at last obliged to bog of him to abstairi from soeking, for her sake, a socjety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper ta lnterpose, and, fearing tbat his mjnd was becoming alienated, they thought it bigh time to resumo ogain that trusl which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the jnjuries and sufferings he had daiIy encountered in hiſ wanderings, clnd of preventing him from exposing to the gencral eye thase marks of what they corisidered solly, they engaged a pbysician to reside in the house, and take coristant core of him. He hardly appeared t0 notice it, so completely was his mind absorbod by one terrible subject. His incoherence becamo at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There ho would often lie for dayf, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciatod, his eyes had ottained a glassy lustre;—the only sign ofaffection and recollectjon remaining displayed itself upon the eritry os his si ster; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, be would desire her not lo louch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your 1ove for me is aught, do not g0 near him!\" Wheri, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again ho sank into a state, whence nat even she cauld rouſe him. This lasted mariy months: graduaIly, however, as lhe year was passing, his incoherences became less frequcnt, and hjf mind threw off cl portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that sevcral times ln theday be would caunt upon bjs fingers a definlte number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the yeor, one of his guardlans entering his room, begari to converse with his physician upon the melancholy clrcumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was goirig next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he aſked anxiously to whom. GIad of this mark of returnirig intcllect, of whicb they feared he had been doprlved, they mentionod the riarno of thc Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and aſtonisbed them still more by his expressing his intentionto be preserilat the nuptials, and desiring to soe his sister. They answered not, but iri a few minutes his sjster was with him. He was apparently again capable of being afsected by the influenoe of her lovely smile; for he pressedher to his breast, and kisfed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thovght of her brother's beirig once more alive to the feelings of afseotlon. He began to speak with al1 his wonted warinth, and to congratvlote hcr upon her marriage with a perſon so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was hiſ surprisc al beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He sejzed the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the rcsemblance of her future husband,he looked as if he did nat vnderstand her—tben seizing her hands, and gazing on ber with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But hc could nol advance—it seemed as if lhat voice again bado him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking L0rd Ruthven wcls near him but saw no one. In tho meantime the guardiansand phyſician, who had heard the whole, andthought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desircd her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, atlributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of hif mind, erideavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-rooin, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Auhrey's ill health, he readily uriderstood himself to be the cavse of il; but when he lcarned that he waf deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be conceclled from those among whom he had gained this iriformation. He hastened to the house of his former companiori, and, byconstant atteridanee, and the pretence of great affectjon for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradvcllly wan the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recovnt—could speak af himsels as of an individval havirig no syinpathy with ony being on the crowded earth, savc with her to whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his exjftence, had 6egun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might liston to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. Tbe title of the elder branch falling at lenglh to hlm, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for bastenirig the marriage, (in spite of ber br0ther's deranged state,) which was to takc place the uery day before hif deporture for the contlnent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the fervonls, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; jt was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her,as she valued her owri happincss, her own hanour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who ance held her ln their arins aſ their hope and the hope of thoir house, to delay bvt for a few bours tbatmclrriage, 0n which he denounced tbe most heavy curscs. Tbe servants pramised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thovght it better not to harasſ ony more the mind of Misf Aubreyby, what he consjdered, the rclvings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest ta the busy lnmates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easjly be oonceived than described, the notes af busy prcparatlon. Morning come, and lhe sound ofcarriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew aImost franlic. The curiosity of the servants at laft ovcrearne their vigiIonce, they gradually stole away, leaving him in tbe cust0dy of an be1pless old womari. He seized the opportunity, with onc bound was out of the room, and in a moment found hlmself jn the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takirig his arm by soree, hurried bim srom the room, speechless with rclge. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Re member your oath, and know, if not my bride to doy, your sister is dishonourod. Women are srail!\" S0 saying, he puſhed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, cls the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weclkneſs increased; the effusi0n of blood produced symptoms af the near approach of deoth. Hedesirod his sister's guardians might be called, and when lhe midnight h0ur had struck, he related composedly what the reader haf perused—he dicd immediately after.\nThe guardianshasteried lo protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was loo latc. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted tho thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND DF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE,&c.\n\"The world was all before hirn, where lo ch0ose his pIace of rest, and Providence his gvide.\"\nIN Sailing throvgb tbe Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels,in the year 1812, we putinto the harbour ofMitylene, iri the island of tbat narne. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply os cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induoe many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and inorcbantmen; and tbough it ljes rather out of lhe track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply ropay for the devialion of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purscr bargaining for cattle with tho natives, the clergyman and myfelf took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and othcr places, where wo had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mo nticvle so named) we met with and engaged a y0ung Greek as our gvide, who told us he had eome fram Scio with an English lord, who left the islond four days previous lo our arriual in bls felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said tbe Greek, \"clnd would have taken rne with him; hut I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am like1y to get marricd. He was an odd, but a very good man. The eottage over the hlll, facjng the ri ver, beIongs to him, arid he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trclder, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 Engljsh currency,) arid has refided there about f0urteen montbs, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very osten to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosjty very much, and we lost no tiine in hastening to the housewhere our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us aver the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floar—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-roorn, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on eithor side, a lar ge myrtle in the centre, and a smclll fountain beneath, which co uld be made to play through thc branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning poslure; o large couch or sofa completed the furniture. Inthe hall stood half a dozen English cane cbairſ, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor asingle paintlng. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on tbe floar, with two stuffed cotton quilts arid a pillow—the comman bed tbroughout Greece. In the sitling-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with boaks and papers, which were then iri a large seainan's chest in the closet: it was apen, but we dld not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of tbe recess lay Voltairc's, Shakspeclre's, Boileau's, and Rousfeau's works complete; VoIney's Rulns of Empires;Zjmmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 181O; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with inarginal notos, written with a pencil, in Italian ond Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and markcd with ſljps of paper, an which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading lhese books the evening before be sailcd,and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they musl lje until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon mo for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him cl service; and I have tbe produce of lhiſ farm for the troublc os taking eare of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearonce of the ha use externally was plcasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pil1ars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grccian architeeture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, waſ covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them thc Grceks pass tbeir evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying tbe cvening breeze.\nOn the left hand os we enterod the house, a sma1l streamlct glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shclde of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on whjchwe were lold, the lord pasſed many of his evenings and nigbts till twelvc o'clock, reading, wriling, andtalking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was vory devout, \"and always attended our chureb twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this soat waswhat may bc termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led lhe eye to M0unt Calcla, covered with olive and inyrtle trees in blaom, and on the summit of wbich an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smaIl stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascodes, until it waf last in the woods near the mauntain's baſc. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizori unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view iri front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chcsnut clnd palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with fpots of emerald green. I seldom onioyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitlcss as to the name of the person who bad resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Arme-\nnian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare n0t.\" We had nat time to visit the Armenian, bvl on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of tbe isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to onc man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thc glrls who live by weaving these articles. He a1so bought a new boat far a fisherman wbo had Iost his own in a gclle, ond he often gave Greek Testaments to tbe poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolentchclracler. One circumstance we learnt, which our old frierid at the cottage thought proper not to disc1ose. He had a most beautiful daugb ter, with whom the lord was often seen wal klng on the sea-shore, and he had boughl hera piano-forte, and taught her hlmself the use of it.\nSuch was the iriformation wilh which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imclgjnations all on the raok, guesslng who this rainblerin Grecce could be. He had money jt was evident: hehad philanthropy of disposition, and all thoso eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company wilh Mr. FOSTER, the architcct, a pupil os WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The indivjdual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, if Lord Byron;I met him in my travels on the island af Tenodos, and I cllso uisited him at Mitylcne.\" We had nevcr then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had becn some years from home; but \"ChiIde Harolde\" 6eing put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Ca1cla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the eottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, belieuing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has heen described as of on unfeeling disposition, averse to associatjng with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is direetly lhe reverse, as inoy be plairily gathered srom these little anecdotes. AlI tbe finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicled in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatby, and charily appeclr to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason f0r rnarkjng hirn as a being on whose heart Religion hath sct her seal, and ouer whose hecld Benevolcnce hatbthrown her mant le. No man can read the preceding pleafing \"traits\" without f eeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not asſumc a right l0 give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when direcled against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before thal awful tribunal where all must appear, al0ne may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's eharacter is worthy of bis genius. To do goad in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous hcart and seIf-approving c onsoience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Flcet-slreet.",
    "clean": "By promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more."
